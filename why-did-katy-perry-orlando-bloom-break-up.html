In fact, years before welcoming their daughter and planning their wedding, Orlando and Katy dated, then split up for a bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There wasn't a ton of drama surrounding the former couple at the time, but fans have long wondered exactly why they split, and how they wound up back together and happier than ever.</p><p><strong>Updated on October 12, 2022:</strong> Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are still working on their wedding planning. Perry is currently performing in her Las Vegas residency, but that isn't stopping her from hammering out details for her upcoming nuptials. She recently shared on The Drew Berrymore Show that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Bloom are still figuring out the venue</a>, searching for the perfect spot for the couple to celebrate their love.</p><h2 id=how-did-katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-meet>How Did Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Meet?</h2><p>During the premiere of <a href=#><strong>American Idol</strong></a> in 2019, <a href=#>Katy opened up about how she had met her boyfriend</a>, Orlando Bloom, at the 2016 Golden Globes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Katy Perry Has Been Up To Since Getting Engaged To Orlando Bloom</a></span></p><p>The romance between the stars continued when they attended Harvey Weinstein's Golden Globes after-party, which was held at Beverly Hilton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo were reportedly flirting a lot at the party as they were spotted interacting by storms. While at one point during their chat, the Pirates of the Caribbean star leaned in extra close to Perry as she was laughing, later, Orlando was spotted typing something into Katy's phone.</p><p>"He would lean in to whisper into her ear and touch the small of her back as they chatted," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider had reported about Bloom's interaction with Perry to US Weekly back then</a>.</p><p>Perry and Bloom had met for the first time in April 2013. However, at the time, both the stars were in different relationships — Katy with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, John Mayer, and Orlando with his then-wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr.</p><p>But there's no bad blood with Orlando's ex, at least; the three are a happy co-parenting pod these days, with <a href=#>Katy and Miranda developing a special friendship</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-katy-and-orlando-break-up>Why Did Katy And Orlando Break Up?</h2><p>The couple were so in love until mid-January 2017 as the "Roar" singer organized a surprise birthday party for Bloom. No one could see their break-up approaching in the same year, so it was a shock when their split was announced officially.</p><p>In March 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement from Perry and Bloom's reps revealed the news of the breakup</a> to E! Online stating, "Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time."</p><p>Perhaps it was both the stars' demanding schedules at the time that led to their unexpected split since Katy was busy promoting her fourth studio album, and Orlando was actively dedicating a massive duration of his time to UNICEF's charities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Katy Perry And Russell Brand's Divorce</a></span></p><p>When enthusiasts kept prodding the topic for any loopholes, Katy took to Twitter to clear the air of any rumors that suggested a nasty split between her and Orlando, pointing out that one can be on amicable terms with their former lover after a break-up.</p><p>In a 2020 interview for the Canadian radio show Q on CBC, Katy acknowledged her distress after her break-up with Orlando. "I don't know if my smile was ever fully, like, authentically mine, but I was riding on the high of a smile for a long time," she told host Tom Power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-reconciled-in-2018>Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Reconciled In 2018</h2><p>Much to everyone's delight, the fan-favorite couple reunited not long after they split in 2017, as they were spotted attending an Adele concert. In March 2018, their relationship was confirmed when Perry went to Prague, where Bloom was shooting a new series.</p><p>"In the past few months, they have spent a lot of time together. They both love traveling and are trying to share as many fun trips as possible. They are dating, but not necessarily putting a label on it…," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source had told People about the duo's relationship in 2018</a>.</p><p>The "Dark Horse" singer announced her engagement to Orlando Bloom in February 2019 via an Instagram post where she flaunted her flower-shaped ruby and diamond engagement ring as the couple sat huddled together adorably. But the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic played a vital role in <a href=#>delaying the happy-go-lucky couple's wedding</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Katy Perry Want More Kids With Orlando Bloom?</a></span></p><p>In March 2020, the songstress had confirmed her pregnancy through the music video of her song "Never Worn White" in which she is seen cradling her baby bump. Later that year, she disclosed that she would be the mother to a baby girl, who was named Daisy upon birth.</p><p>Though they have had some trouble along their path to the altar, the pair still plans to wed, and given their history, fans don't doubt it will happen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Dad Of The Year': Katy Perry Praises Shirtless Orlando Bloom As He Decorates Daisy's Bedroom</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqaq7JloJq%2Fs8WMqKmlmZ6ZvG6uy6impmWSp7Kit4yup2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bayardo-de-murguia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-47431-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" Bayardo De Murguia">&larr;
