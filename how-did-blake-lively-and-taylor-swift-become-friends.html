Despite, holidaying, spending birthdays and fourth of Julys together, Blake directing one of Taylor’s music videos, and Taylor even name-dropping Blake’s children in her song, their relationship seemingly got off to a rocky start as 'Swifties' took issue with comments made by Blake on social media in regard to Taylor's work.</p><h2 id=blake-lively-sparked-her-friendship-with-taylor-swift-on-instagram>Blake Lively Sparked Her Friendship With Taylor Swift On Instagram</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/set_taylor_swift_bad_blood_640-e1619148449707.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blake Lively first publicly referenced Taylor Swift’s music in 2015 in a now-deleted Instagram post after starring in a L’Oreal campaign featuring a roster of celebrity A-Listers, which Lively likened to the ‘Bad Blood’ music video, saying: ‘sooo, turns out this WASN’T a video shoot for John Legend’s cover of Bad Blood.’</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Bad Blood": Is Taylor Swift Still Friends With All The Ladies From The Music Video?</a></span></p><p>This playful and quite apt comparison was met with criticism, however, as fans of Swift jumped to her defense, believing Lively to have ‘thrown shade’ at Taylor and the ‘Bad Blood’ music video.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively very quickly rushed to clear up the misunderstanding</a> and expressed her adoration for Taylor Swift, sharing, ‘Umm whoever thought I was throwin shade clearly doesn’t know I have a Taylor Swift Please Be My Wife Voo Doo Doll,’ along with a picture of her young niece at one of Taylor’s concerts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor clearly didn’t take offense to Blake’s harmless comments as the pair soon began their friendship just two months later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spending a day off together at ‘Movie World’ in Queensland</a> while Taylor was touring her 1989 show and Blake was filming The Shallows in Australia.</p><p>Blake Lively was also spotted by fans in the crowd of Taylor’s Brisbane show just a day earlier, solidifying her status as the Taylor super fan she had so claimed to be.</p><h2 id=blake-lively-directed-taylor-swift-rsquo-s-video-for-lsquo-i-bet-you-think-about-me-rsquo>Blake Lively Directed Taylor Swift’s Video For ‘I Bet You Think About Me’</h2><p>In 2021, Taylor and Blake temporarily took their friendship to a more professional space, as Blake had her <a href=#>directorial debut working on the music video for Red (Taylor’s Version) song, 'I Bet You Think About Me.'</a></p><p>Following the rights to her discography being sold by her old record label, Big Machine Records, Taylor has since endeavored to rerecord her first six albums in an effort to take rightful ownership of her lengthy catalog of music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Red (Taylor’s Version) was the second album that Taylor opted to rerecord, following Fearless (Taylor's Version) also in 2021.</p><p>‘I Bet You Think About Me’ didn’t feature on Taylor’s original version of the album in 2012 but was taken from the archives for the re-release, or ‘Taylor’s Version,’ and put out as a single.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Blake Lively Posts Taylor Swift Reference Following Video Release</a></span></p><p>Interestingly though, Blake Lively is not the only member of her household to have collaborated with Swift on one of her projects, and by no means is she the first.</p><p>Lively and Reynolds’ eldest daughter James was, in fact, Taylor’s first collaborator from the family as Swift sampled James’ voice at the beginning of the Reputation track, ‘Gorgeous’ in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-reveal-the-name-of-blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds-rsquo-fourth-child>Did Taylor Swift Reveal The Name Of Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds’ Fourth Child?</h2><p>With Blake Lively’s recent Super Bowl Sunday Instagram post, casually showing her without her pregnant stomach, acting as a sort of makeshift birth announcement, fans of the Gossip Girl star have been left to fill in many of the blanks surrounding the birth of her and Ryan Reynolds’ fourth child.</p><p>The name of the baby, however, has been speculated since as early as October 2022 upon the release of Taylor Swift’s latest album, Midnights.</p><p>In 2020, Taylor affectionately expressed her love for Lively, Reynolds, and their family on her album Folklore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">naming characters in her song ‘betty’ after the couple’s children</a>, James and Inez, and even revealed the name of their third child through her titular character, Betty.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Blake Lively Can't Stop Watching Taylor Swift's Disney+ Folklore Concert</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is with this in mind that fans of Swift and the Lively-Reynolds household grew curious about the significance of the name ‘Daisy May’ in ‘You’re On Your Own, Kid’ on Taylor’s tenth studio album, Midnights, and wondered if, like ‘betty,’ the name related to Taylor’s friendship with the couple and <a href=#>perhaps revealed the name of Blake’s fourth child</a>.</p><p>Taylor is known by her audience to be a fan of burying Easter eggs and hidden meanings throughout her music, so there is no doubt that she planned for Daisy May to get people talking and create rumors.</p><p>Whether this was yet another baby name reveal or an intentional diversion remains to be seen, however, and at this point, it seems as though only Blake and Ryan can clear that up for fans, in due time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p
