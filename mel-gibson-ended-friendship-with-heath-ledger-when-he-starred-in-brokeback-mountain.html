Miller being canceled</a>. Despite that, Mel Gibson continues to work both behind and in front of the camera. A big portion of the reason for that is the fact that Gibson has so many Hollywood connections.</p><p>During Heath Ledger's career, there were <a href=#>rumors about his relationships with his co-stars</a>. However, while some <a href=#>co-stars don't get along</a>, Ledger once became pals with Gibson when they worked together. After Ledger and Gibson bonded, their relationship allegedly was ruined because of Brokeback Mountain.</p><h2 id=did-heath-ledger-and-mel-gibson-39-s-friendship-end-over-brokeback-mountain>Did Heath Ledger And Mel Gibson's Friendship End Over Brokeback Mountain?</h2><p>At first glance, the idea that Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson were friends may seem strange. However, putting aside the controversies, it is pretty easy to see how Gibson and Ledger could have become close at one point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mel-gibson-and-heath-ledger-from-the-patriot.jpg><p>In the year 2000, The Patriot was released with Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger in the starring roles. During the production of that film, Ledger and Gibson got to know each other. As two people with a passion for acting who spent a lot of their youth living in Australia, Gibson and Ledger likely had a lot in common.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How successful was The Patriot</a> according to The Numbers?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>The Patriot</p></td><td><p>2000</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Production Budget: $110,000,000</p></td><td><p>Domestic Box Office: $113,330,342</p></td><td><p>Worldwide Box Office: $215,300,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>No matter what led to Ledger and Gibson becoming friends, the interesting thing is how their relationship ended. While it is important to note that neither Gibson nor Ledger spoke about their friendship ending, their bond reportedly was severed due to a movie role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mere days after Ledger passed away, The New York Daily News published an article about his relationship with Gibson. According to that report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship ended because Ledger starred in Brokeback Mountain</a> even though Gibson told him not to.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anne-hathaway-and-jake-gyllenhaal-in-brokeback-mountain.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Anne Hathaway Almost Quit Acting, But This $178 Million Movie With Heath Ledger Changed Her Career Path">Anne Hathaway Almost Quit Acting, But This $178 Million Movie With Heath Ledger Changed Her Career Path</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Anne Hathaway's role in Brokeback Mountain pushed her career in ways she could have never anticipated.</p><p>For their report, The New York Daily News cited a private investigator named Paul Barresi. The article also claimed that Gibson was against Ledger starring in Brokeback Mountain over a moral stand the elder actor took against the film.</p><p>"Ledger and Gibson had grown close while filming “The Patriot,” in which Ledger played Gibson’s son. 'Ledger asked Gibson whether he should take the role of Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback,' Barresi says a 'major Hollywood producer' told him. 'Gibson strongly counseled against it. The role apparently ran counter to Gibson’s morality. And he felt that it would ruin Heath’s career.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of The New York Daily News' report, Gibson's representatives denied the story.

As anyone familiar with Ledger will know, his career went to another level due to the acclaim the actor's Brokeback Mountain performance garnered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on Gibson's own remarks, his relationship with Ledger didn't get better after Brokeback Mountain was a hit. During an interview, Gibson spoke about losing contact with Ledger for years. Gibson also once spoke about the regret he felt that he didn't reach out to Ledger near the end.</p><h2 id=what-did-mel-gibson-say-about-heath-ledger-39-s-passing>What Did Mel Gibson Say About Heath Ledger's Passing?</h2><p>On January 22nd 2008, Heath Ledger passed away far too early in life. After the actor's passing, it was concluded that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ledger passed away from an accidental overdose</a>.

Despite that, Gibson has done good things in his life. One notable example of that is the fact that Gibson has offered aid to several young stars who were battling personal demons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, an extremely close associate of Britney Spears' revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gibson once reached out to offer her help</a>.

When Downey Jr. was honored at the American Cinematheque ceremony in 2011, he spoke about how Gibson saved his life. After the two actors worked together on the 1990 film Air America, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gibson urged Downey Jr. not to give up in his battle to get sober</a>.</p><p>“When I couldn’t get sober, Mel told me not to give up hope, and he urged me to find my faith.
