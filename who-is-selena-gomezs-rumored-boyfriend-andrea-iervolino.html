Since breaking out on the scene during her Disney Channel days, the actress has expanded her influence through acting, creating music, launching of a beauty line, and producing on-screen ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the exception of her more well-known romances with Justin Bieber and The Weeknd, she has kept her personal life pretty discreet while pursuing her career. The singer has been associated with people like Charlie Puth, Nick Jonas, Orlando Bloom, Niall Horan, and even Taylor Lautner throughout the years.</p><p>Recently, rumor has it that she has found a new boyfriend.</p><h2 id=who-is-selena-rsquo-s-rumored-boyfriend-andrea-iervolino>Who Is Selena’s Rumored Boyfriend, Andrea Iervolino?</h2><p>Surrounded by her closest friends and her rumored boyfriend, Selena Gomez celebrated her 30th birthday in Italy. The singer was captured boarding the luxurious yacht in Positano with a helping hand from the film producer Andrea Iervolino.</p><p>Reports claimed that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two have been linked together</a> in the past but never confirmed that they are in a romantic relationship. In the published photos, Selena and Andrea did spend quite a lot of time during her trip and were seen dancing, hugging, sharing forehead kisses, and looking generally enamored on the yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But before the recent getaway of the two, they have known each other already. Selena Gomez starred in the 2016 film The Dubious Battle, which was produced by Andrea Iorvolino. The pair seem to have been friends since, and he was in fact present at the singer-actress’s 27th birthday celebration when she visited Italy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Justin Bieber The Richest Guy Selena Gomez Has Been With?</a></span></p><p>While the two remained silent about the rumors, here are the things to know about Selena’s rumored boyfriend, Andrea Iervolino. The Italian-Canadian hunk is a renowned filmmaker who reportedly made his producing debut in the United States with The Merchant of Venice, which had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2004.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, he has produced a plethora of other films, and most recently, his production business, Irvolino & Lady Bacardi Entertainment SpA, worked on the A-list cast movie Trading Paint. The cast of the film includes John Travolta, Shania Twain, and Tony Sebastian.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All Of The Younger Men Selena Gomez Has Dated</a></span></p><p>The Mimmo Rotella Special Award for Production at the Venice Film Festival in 2015 for The Humbling and the Saving Award at the Italian Contemporary Film Festival in 2016 are just a few of the amazing honors Andrea has received over the years.</p><p>He was also named an ambassador of Italian Cinema and president of the Ischia Global Film and Music Festival that same year.</p><h2 id=is-selena-gomez-still-single>Is Selena Gomez Still Single?</h2><p>Some speculation about the singer’s dating history seems to be valid, but others are clearly just rumors. Either way, she certainly keeps her fans on their toes when it comes to her relationships. In fact, <a href=#>she frankly stated that her love life is “cursed.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said, “I think most of my experiences in relationships have been cursed. I’ve been way too young to be exposed to certain things when I was in relationship.”</p><p>She added that feeling “so less than” led her to explore what her “rare,” which turned into her 2020 alum of the same name.</p><p>The singer has been in a happier state even without a lover on her side. In her Tiktok vide, she joked in the clip, “No, I’m fine. I’m totally fine being single. It’s a real thing. It’s fine,” before pointing the camera at her friends and their significant others.</p><p>While there are some people who thought <a href=#>Selena hasn’t moved on from her past failed relationship with Justin</a>, the singer has nothing to say but her excitement about getting older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She admitted, “I have no idea what to expect. Getting older is weird, but I love it. And I’m finding out new things about myself. It’s honestly…I enjoy getting older. Here’s to 30.” She added, “I love getting older. I love living life, and I love learning and growing and traveling and meeting amazing people.
