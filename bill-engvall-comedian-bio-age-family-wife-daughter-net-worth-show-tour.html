The series starred comedian Bill Engvall and was written and created by Michael Leeson and Engvall. On September 25, 2009, the series was canceled.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-family></span>Bill Engvall Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bill is married to Gail Engvall, he has a daughter named Emily Engvall and a son called Travis Engvall. Bill hasalso a sister named Janet Engvall McTigue.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-wife></span>Bill Engvall Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bill has been married to Gail Engvall since December 18, 1982. The couple has a daughter named Emily (born 1986), a 2008 graduate from the University of Puget Sound, as well as a son, Travis (born June 25, 1991), a 2015 graduate from Northern Arizona University; both of whom are often mentioned during his routines. Engvall lives in southern California when not on tour and maintains a blog for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on the website of Fox Sports West.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-career></span>Bill Engvall Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bill Engvall moved to southern California in 1990 to dedicate full-time to his comedy. Early notoriety came from hosting the cable show A Pair of Jokers with Rosie O’Donnell and an appearance on The Golden Palace where he played Blanche’s son Matthew, a stockbroker turned aspiring comic. Other Engvall’s early appearances included hosting A&E Networks An Evening at The Improv as well as stand-up routines on The Tonight Show and the Late Show with David Letterman.</p><p>A career breakthrough happened in 1992 when he was named Best Male Standup at the American Comedy Awards. Engvall’s first role as a series regular came soon after when he was cast in the ABC series Delta, starring Delta Burke. However, the show only lasted one season and Engvall returned to making the rounds of comedy clubs and the occasional television appearance until 1996 when he was cast in the NBC version of The Jeff Foxworthy Show with fellow comic and best friend Jeff Foxworthy. Signed by Warner Bros.</p><p>Engvall released the first of a series of highly successful comedy albums, Here’s Your Sign in 1996, based on his signature stage bit. The album was certified Platinum and peaked at #5 on the Billboard Country album chart, thanks in part to the single and video of the same title on which he collaborated with country singer Travis Tritt. Eight more comedy albums followed including Dorkfish in 1998 and 2009’s Aged and Confused. He also attended the NASCAR After The Lap event in 2011 in Las Vegas.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-blue-collar-comedy-tour></span>Bill Engvall Blue Collar Comedy Tour<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jeff Foxworthy and Engvall launched the first of 6 Blue Collar Comedy Tours in 2000. The tours also featured Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy and were largely responsible for their breakout success. Each of the 6 years of the tour were very successful and spawned 3 films, a satellite radio show and a television show titled Blue Collar TV on The WB Network.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-game-show-host></span>Bill Engvall Game show host<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Engvall started a new chapter in his career on June 6, 2011, as he took over as host of the re-launched Lingo on GSN. According to an interview in American Profile magazine, he said he jumped at the chance to host the show, citing the fun his friend Foxworthy had hosting Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. Engvall had been a fan of Lingo when it aired a few years previously before coming to an end in 2007, admitting that his wife always beat him to the answers. When asked if there were any plans to have buddies Foxworthy or Larry The Cable Guy appear on Lingo, he replied, “You never know! I would love to have them on the show because it would be a blast. I would really dig that.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-dancing-with-the-stars></span>Bill Engvall Dancing with the Stars<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Engvall was announced in 2013, as a contestant on the 17th season of Dancing with the Stars paired with professional dancer Emma Slater. In the first week, Engvall danced the Foxtrot and received a score of 18. The second week was Latin week and he saw some higher scores from the judges receiving a 21 for his Jive. And the third week of competition, he saw his highest score of 24 with a Paso Doble to the Lone Ranger theme song.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the show, the judges usually placed Engvall and Slater at the bottom of the leaderboard, but an enormous fan base kept them in the competition, resulting in higher-scoring contestants, e.g. Christina Milian, Brant Daugherty, Snooki, Elizabeth Berkley and Leah Remini being voted out instead. Engvall and Slater made it to the finals on November 18, together with Amber Riley, Jack Osbourne and Corbin Bleu. The two finished in 4th place.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-engvall-tour-upcoming-events></span>Bill Engvall Tour | Upcoming Events<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Sep 22 2019• Deadwood, SD</li><li>Sep 28 2019 • Fort Wayne, IN</li><li>Oct 19 2019 • Larchwood, IA</li><li>Oct 24 2019 • Fort Lauderdale, FL</li><li>Oct 25 2019 • Clearwater, FL</li><li>Oct 26 2019 • Asheville, NC</li><li>Nov 8 2019 • Greensburg, PA</li><li>Jan 10 2020 • Greenville, SC</li><li>Feb 14 2020 • Orange Park, FL</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fl7atuIyepaCukaG5bq%2FOppydoZGjeqO1zmaYoJ1dm66utcuyZLChlpp6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiu6bAjLCmq6yYYsCpu9Zmq6itomQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chelsea-carter-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-161513-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chelsea Carter Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
