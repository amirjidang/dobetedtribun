One simply wouldn't be successful without the other. This is something both of these radio legends are well aware of. After all, they often make this claim on their long-running radio show that's been on SiriusXM satellite since 2006. Not only are these two co-hosts, but they are actually extremely close friends. Robin even <a href=#>credits Howard for keeping her alive</a> during her horrendous battle with cancer. Howard's support and creative platform have done a lot for Robin, including giving her an opportunity to reveal and even poke fun at some of the darkest chapters in her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of The Stern Show know precisely the horrendous things Robin experienced at the hands of her father. And readers of her 1995 autobiography, "Quivers: A Life" know even more. While Robin doesn't regret sharing her story with the world on The Howard Stern Show, she has recently claimed that she deeply regrets publishing her best-selling book. Here's why...</p><h2 id=the-biggest-revelation-in-robin-quivers-39-book-was-her-horrendous-relationship-with-her-father>The Biggest Revelation In Robin Quivers' Book Was Her Horrendous Relationship With Her Father</h2><p>Robin Quivers has been part of some of the greatest bits in the history of Howard Stern. Not only that but she's been as open and honest as the self-proclaimed King Of All Media. She has shared <a href=#>some truly embarrassing stories</a> and <a href=#>hasn't been afraid to challenge her friend</a> and colleague on a number of occasions. But one of the things Robin is best known for is revealing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the sexual abuse she suffered</a> at the hands of her father when she was just a little girl. While the details of which are just too dark to go into here, the radio show never shied away from satirizing them. It's clear that Robin knew that laughing at some of the darkest and most inappropriate aspects of her history would help her overcome it. But she took things a step or two further in her 1995 autobiography, "Quivers: A Life".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the book, Robin detailed what her father did to her, how she overcame it, and how she managed to have some semblance of a relationship with him and her mother who victim-blamed. Even to this day, Robin knows that the book got a rise out of her parents.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 25th, 2021</a>, Howard and Robin discussed <a href=#>Real Housewives</a> star Erika Jayne and her terrible scandal. Howard claimed that if he was ever involved in a scandal like that, he would claim that he had Alzheimer's disease in order to get out of it. This is something Robin saw a parallel to with her father and his own illness in his later years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Meghan McCain Really Thinks About Howard Stern</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You know, it's very interesting when I wrote my book, you know -- my book was not easy on my parents," Robin said. "So I sent them a copy to read and I said, 'I'm coming down to talk to you about it because, look, this is going to be out there'. My mother was very angry and, you know, making a bit deal about it. My father was supposed to have Alzheimer's, right, and he's sitting there like a lump in the other chair. My mother's going, 'Well, why did you have to do this!' And blah, blah, blah. And then all of a sudden my father said, 'You didn't have to tell everybody.' And I was like, 'Wait a minute! The lump just spoke!' He had feelings about it too. And I turned to him and said, 'Well, you didn't have to do it!'"</p><p>"Good for you," Howard responded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But it was very interesting that all of a sudden he put all that together with his Alzheimer's," Robin said. "He was hardly able to put words together and then all of a sudden he was ready to join this argument."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Robin Quivers' Massive Net Worth From The Howard Stern Show</a></span></p><h2 id=why-robin-quivers-regrets-writing-quot-quivers-a-life-quot>Why Robin Quivers Regrets Writing "Quivers: A Life"</h2><p>Even though Howard's radio show is filled with brutal honesty. And in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, Howard was all about going for the shock-value. This is why he even hosted Robin's father on the show so she could confront him about what he had done to her -- even though he had Alzheimer's at that point. Still, in his personal life, Howard would never have done anything of the sort. He's far too docile off-air. Robin, on the other hand, is bold, according to Howard, and wasn't afraid of absolutely obliterating her parents in her book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Do you have any regrets about writing the book?" Howard asked Robin almost three decades after it was released.</p><p>"I regret that I had to do a big f*** you to my parents, yeah. I wasn't mature enough, or I hadn't evolved enough to realize that the book was a just a big f*** you," Robin admitted. "I always promised them that I'd get them back. [through laughs] And I went through with that plan."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern's Co-Host Robin Quivers Dated This Controversial Celebrity</a></span></p><p>"So, you did. You had regrets. I didn't know that. We don't talk about that."</p><p>"Yeah. People say, 'Oh, I read your book'. And I'm like, 'Uhhh...'," Robin said. "I'm happy I'm an example of someone who has overcome a lot. But what bothers me is the consequence sot other people. It doesn't bother me that I told my story. It bothers me the consequences that it had on other people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Robin Quivers Did This To Howard Stern At A Dinner Party</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJqZo3qywcivnKurXaeyqL7Erapmmp%2BkuG7Dx5qrZqCVp3qxrdGepa2rXZm2pXnTqGShnaJitbDDwKubZqukmr%2Bvew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-smith-margot-robbie-deepfake-actor-faces-heat-after-video-goes-viral-on-domain-10.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Smith-Margot Robbie deepfake: Actor faces heat after video goes viral on Reddit">&larr;
