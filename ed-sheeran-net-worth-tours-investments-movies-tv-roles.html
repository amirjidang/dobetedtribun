His music was recognized throughout the UK prior to his first album, however his first single, The A Team is what allowed him to gain success and popularity in the United States and Canada.</p><p>After his first album, it was only uphill for Sheeran. The star, who was able to <a href=#>overcome a serious case of stuttering</a>, released a number of albums, all of which have soared to number one on the Billboard 200, and has even earned himself two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard Hot 100</a> number-one songs in the United States, which is quite the feat for a British musician.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ed Sheeran's Wife Cherry Seaborn's Life Changed Forever After Her Cancer Diagnosis, Here's How She Handled It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Sheeran has gone on to tour some of the biggest stadium tours to date and continues to write not only his own songs but songs for many other artists as well. It has become clear that Sheeran is one musician not to be underestimated. And with not only one album released in 2023 but a second album due out Fall 2023, Sheeran is on fire.</p><p>Here is everything we know about Ed Sheeran, and just how he came to earn his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 million net worth.</a></p><p><strong>Updated August 2023:</strong> Ed Sheeran is proving that while he has hundreds of millions to his name, he has no desire to slow down with his career.</p><p>This year alone, Sheeran released Subtract and has plans to release another album, Autumn Variations in Fall 2023.</p><p>With two little girls under three years old, it appears that Sheeran does not have any plans to tour at this time. However, it would not be surprising if a tour as announced in the next year or so to promote the new music Sheeran has written and produced since his last, incredibly successful tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Sheeran is known to live a fairly frugal lifestyle despite his fortune, it is clear that any project he chooses to work on will only continue to grow his net worth, allowing Sheeran and his family to live a very comfortable lifestyle barring any unforeseen issues in the future.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran-was-the-richest-british-musician-under-30><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ed Sheeran Was The Richest British Musician Under 30</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar45957541-1.jpg><p>Sheeran has proven himself to be quite the artist!

It not only charted at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks but made Sheeran a whopping $7 million in Spotify streams in the United Kingdom alone. When the United States sales are added in, it's clear that Ed Sheeran made a heck of a killing on this one song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ed Sheeran May Not Be The Least Likely Of Eminem's Celebrity Connections</a></span></p><p>As of August 2023, Shape of You has hit 2.8 billion streams and has 5.9 billion streams on YouTube.</p><h2 id=his-divide-tour-secured-him-millions><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>His Divide Tour Secured Him Millions</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ed-sheeran-performs-for-today-show-after-nearly-quitting-music.jpg><p>Shape Of You was the lead single off of Sheeran's album Divide. The album launched a whopping 265 worldwide city-sold-out tour. This was easily one of the longest tours to date by any artist, and its record-breaking stats prove just that.</p><p>In 2020, Sheeran held<a href=#> the record for the most successful tour of all time</a>. The Divide Tour brought in a whopping $775.6 million, beating out previous records held by U2, Guns N' Roses, Sir Paul McCartney, and Taylor Swift.

However, when it comes to Sheeran, it's really just him and perhaps one or two other people.</p><p>This not only means that Sheeran secures the rights to his own songs, but he also makes money off of recording the song and then gets all the royalties and pure sales from units sold considering he is the primary songwriter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Ed Sheeran Ended Up Sleeping On Courteney Cox's Couch</a></span></p><p>So, to break it down, Sheeran gets paid for recording, performing, writing, and producing his own songs, meaning, he's making the big bucks!

Sheeran has since gone on to sign British acts such as Jamie Lawson and Foy Vance, all of which have put the record label on the map throughout the United Kingdom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-scored-a-partnership-with-heinz><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ed Sheeran Scored A Partnership With Heinz</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar36583212.png><p>Sheeran is not known for his sponsorships or brand endorsements like many other singers have been. He tends to keep to himself, and considering he's making all that money off of his songwriting, there is no reason to endorse a product unless Sheeran truly wants to.</p><p>While he or his bank account doesn't need it, Sheeran managed to strike up a deal with Heinz Ketchup and even had his very own version called "Edchup". Though details regarding how much he earned from this deal are unknown, it was revealed that his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial alone scored him nearly $500,000</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-appeared-in-a-few-films-and-television-shows><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ed Sheeran Appeared In A Few Films And Television Shows</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar46417560-1.jpg><p>Though Sheeran makes most of his money from his music, he has earned a few fancy paychecks from a number of cameos and appearances he has made in a television shows and movies.</p><p>Sheeran had a small role in Bridget Jones' Baby, appeared in Game Of Thrones, Shortland Street, and Home & Away to name a few.
