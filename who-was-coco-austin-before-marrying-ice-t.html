For example, couples like Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez, or Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds all met when they were already famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some stars wind up marrying people who were nobodies before their marriage</a>. In most of those cases, the unfamous spouse spends most of their time supporting their partner from the sidelines. For examples of that scenario, look no further than the spouses of stars like Jerry Seinfeld, Anne Hathaway, Alec Baldwin, Amy Schumer, and Christian Bale among others.</p><p>Unlike all of those other couples, Ice-T and Coco Austin broke both of those molds. After all, Austin wasn’t famous before she married Ice-T and for all anyone knows, that never would’ve changed had she remained single. On the other hand, she is such a noteworthy person that even if she got divorced tomorrow, she most likely would remain famous. Despite Austin’s current notoriety, the fact remains that most observers know next to nothing about her pre-fame life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Scarlett Johansson Fall For Colin Jost Before The Two Became An Item?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=multimedia-star-and-legend>Multimedia Star And Legend</h2><p>Back in 1991, Ice-T released his 4th studio album which he decided to call “O.G. Original Gangster”. As anyone that knows anything about the history of rap should know, that was a very fitting title. After all, Ice-T wasn’t the first rapper to make his mark but there is no debate that he was one of the originators of gangsta rap.</p><p>Never afraid to upset people, Ice-T’s debut album “Rhyme Pays” was the second in history to carry an explicit content sticker. From there, he then went on to form a heavy metal band called Body Count and one of that group’s songs, which Ice-T wrote the lyrics for, outraged many. The song in question, which was about taking the life of a police officer, became such a political lightning rod that the then President, Vice-President, and a former First Lady all decried it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, after garnering all of that negative press coverage, Ice-T has since managed to completely change his public image. Now perceived by many as a lovable actor who has starred in a slew of mainstream movies and TV shows, at one point that would have been inconceivable. Best known today as the star of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Ice-T has starred in that show for 20 years which is an achievement for the ages. Not only has he been a part of that show all those years, but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many fans also say Ice-T is the reason they love Law and Order: SVU so much</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Rappers Who Could Rap As Fast As Eminem</a></span></p><h2 id=coco-s-time-in-the-spotlight>Coco’s Time In The Spotlight</h2><p>Ever since Coco Austin married Ice-T in 2002 and began showing up on red carpets with him, she has stood out at pretty much every turn. An extremely curvaceous woman who seems to take a lot of pride in her appearance, and for good reason, the outfits she wears to events tend to be quite revealing. For that reason and due to the fact that she has also has a loud personality, Austin has become a star in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Able to land acting roles from time to time, Coco Austin has landed parts in shows like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and several movies including Think Like a Man Too. Much more famous for appearances as herself on television, Austin co-hosted a short-lived talk show called Ice & Coco in 2015. While that series didn’t last long at all, she starred in the “reality” show Ice Loves Coco alongside her husband from 2011 until 2013. As a part of that show, fans came to realize <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much Coco Austin adores her daughter</a>.</p><p>From the outside looking in, it certainly seems like Coco Austin is fearless when it comes to the opportunities that come her way. After all, since she first became famous, Austin has shown up in music videos, competed on Celebrity Family Feud, posed for Playboy and several other publications. That said, it could be argued that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coco Austin’s most interesting non-TV credit is the fact that she performed in the “Peepshow” burlesque show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Were Darcey And Stacey Silva Before 90 Day Fiancé?</a></span></p><h2 id=before-marriage>Before Marriage</h2><p>Born in Tarzana, California, the woman known as Coco Austin today was given the name Nicole at birth. The oldest of 3 children, when Austin’s younger brother struggled to pronounce her birth name, she gained the moniker that so many fans of hers know and love today. Amazingly enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even though Coco Austin is known for her one-of-a-kind and very feminine image today, she was a tomboy</a> that loved to play football and ride quads as a kid.</p><p>First in the public eye when she began modeling at the age of 18, Coco Austin appeared in calendars, catalogs and videos. From there, she won the 1998 Miss Ujena contest in Mexico and began working events as a model, including some at the Playboy mansion. Based on all of those achievements and the fact that Austin appeared in a film called Southwest Babes before she married Ice-T, it is clear that her career was already off to an interesting start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Celebrity Yearbook Photos, Before They Were Famous</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecKomqhlkarAtbXNZpmenp%2Bnsm65wKupsqGenHqqr8Rmq2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-lara-jaworski-north-carolina-woman-passed-away-in-a-car-accident-337045-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Lara Jaworski?
