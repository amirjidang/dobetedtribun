He has recently spoken about learning to work with different personalities and leading with kindness.</p><p>“We live in a world that’s increasingly gamified, and I think we have an instinct to win, crush and kill,” he said. “But if you can disengage or disarm that instinct for a second and replace it with seeking to learn about somebody instead, that, as a leadership quality, for me, has quite literally changed every aspect of my life.”</p><p>Generally, people love working with him, praising the energy he brings to set and the way he handles tricky situations.</p><h2 id=tj-miller-has-called-ryan-reynold-39-s-behavior-quot-weird-quot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>TJ Miller Has Called Ryan Reynold's Behavior "Weird"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Controversial actor TJ Miller, who played Weasel in Deadpool and its 2018 sequel,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> recently said he wouldn’t work with Reynolds</a> again after having “not a great experience” with the actor during filming. Silicon Valley sta4r Miller said he thought Reynolds was “kind of an insecure dude”, adding: “I would not have done Deadpool 3"</p><p>“Would I work with him again? No, I would not work with him again,” Miller said on the Adam Corolla Show earlier this month. “But I’ve said that about Michael Bay, and now we’re friends, and I would work with him again.

So he was like, ‘You know what’s great about you, Weasel? You’re not the star, but you do just enough exposition so that it’s funny, and then we can leave and get back to the real movie.’”</p><p>But apparently, it was all a misunderstanding and the two actors have "emailed" and made up.
