Putting his acting chops aside, <a href=#>he is one of the most inspirational humans on the planet</a>. Despite all his success and wealth, he has maintained a humble mindset and that never changed or deviated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>An Inside Look At Keanu Reeves And Alexandra Grant's Relationship</a></span></p><p>His love life has always been a bit of a mystery, as he keeps his personal life on the down-low. However, most recently, he did shed some light on a prior relationship, one alongside Winona Ryder. <a href=#>The two have a mutual admiration for one another</a> and back in 1992, they really hit it off on the set of 'Dracula'. What fans may not have realized, is that a certain scene in the film was totally authentic, leading to both stars believing they're actually married in real life.</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-got-torn-to-shreds-for-his-performance-in-dracula>Keanu Reeves Got Torn To Shreds For His Performance In Dracula</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Keanu and Winona appeared in the film 'Dracula' alongside one another back in 1992. Given their resumes, most would assume such a film would thrive with the two thrust in the spotlight, however, according to the reviews, it was very much the opposite.</p><p>In particular, <a href=#>Keanu Reeves was criticized for his English accent in the film</a>. Alongside EW, Francis Ford Coppola reminisced on Keanu's struggles during the film.</p><p>''We knew that it was tough for him to affect an English accent. He tried so hard. That was the problem, actually — he wanted to do it perfectly and in trying to do it perfectly it came off as stilted. I tried to get him to just relax with it and not do it so fastidiously. So maybe I wasn’t as critical of him, but that’s because I like him personally so much. To this day he’s a prince in my eyes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Where Do Sandra Bullock And Keanu Reeves Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>It is also said that Reeves arrived at the set completely exhausted, having just shot a film. Despite his shortcomings, Ford Coppolla appreciated his dedication behind the scenes.</p><p>''I know the critics gave him trouble about the accent. But of all the young people I’ve met in the film industry he’s so endearing and sincere, and a good person, and a generous person, and I’m glad I came to know that. He’s the nicest person you’ll ever want to meet."</p><p>It wasn't all bad for Keanu, given the recent news, he might've gotten hitched for real during his time on the film.</p><h2 id=ryder-and-reeves-got-married-in-the-film-with-a-real-priest>Ryder And Reeves Got Married In The Film With A Real Priest</h2><p>Sure, Reeves struggled with an English accident and it wasn't his most memorable work, however, he might've got something that much better in return... a wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Keanu, <a href=#>the ceremony was as real as it gets</a>, with a real priest, all under the eyes of God.</p><p>"We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests," Reeves said in an Esquire video. "Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we're married... under the eyes of God."</p><p>Ryder echoed the same sentiment back in 2018 while the two were promoting 'Destination Wedding'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>''In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest," she said. "We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we're married."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Keanu Reeves Never Makes Contact With Fans When Taking Pictures</a></span></p><p>We'll leave that up to everyone's imaginations, as to whether or not the two are really married. What we do know for sure, is that the celebs grew close to one another during their time on the set. Ryder even recalls an instance of Reeves sticking up for her.</p><h2 id=reeves-turned-down-one-of-coppola-39-s-harsh-requests>Reeves Turned Down One Of Coppola's Harsh Requests</h2><p>All directors have their own approach when it comes to leading the actors and actresses on-set. For Coppola, the scene required that Ryder cry, therefore, he wanted the guys in the film to bash Ryder harshly, to make the tears look a little more authentic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his request, <a href=#>Reeves turned down the tactic</a>, as Ryder detailed alongside Indie Wire.</p><p>“To put it in context I’m supposed to be crying,” Ryder said. “Literally, Richard E. Grant, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu [Reeves]…Francis was trying to get all of them to yell things that would make me cry. But Keanu wouldn’t, Anthony wouldn’t. It just didn’t work. I was, like, really? It kind of did the opposite.”</p><p>It should not come as a surprise that Keanu turned it down. In addition, it is said that Ryder and Coppola were able to get past the situation, despite the awkwardness of that very day.</p><p>Hey, maybe Reeves really is her husband after all...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>The Truth About Keanu Reeves' 'Tragic' Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinpmeqnqzscSvnKxlp567sLrAZqmynJWnerSxwqucraSpYrqivtGinJ1lopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqO%2BwKZkrKyfoLKzv4ydqZqbpaGubsPEnZuippdk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ashleigh-murray-boyfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashleigh Murray: Boyfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements">&larr;
