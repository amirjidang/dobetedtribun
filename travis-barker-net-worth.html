His solo career, with five EPs and more than 60 singles, keeps the cash flowing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And don't forget his side gigs: drumming for other bands, producing tracks, and even teaching aspiring drummers his secrets.</p><p>In 2005, Travis starred in his own reality TV series, Meet the Barkers. The series followed the Blink-182 drummer and his family with his then-wife, Shanna Moakler.</p><p>Barker has appeared in several movies and television shows, including American Pie, Two Guys, A Girl, And A Pizza Place, The Simpsons, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</p><p>Aside from music and television, there's also his merch empire – and in December, he sold a "blood-soaked" pair of Vans as well as similar stained pants, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for $4,000 and $6,000 respectively</a>.</p><p>Given Barker's continued musical endeavors with Blink-182 and his solo projects, lucrative brand collaborations, and entrepreneurial ventures (like his CBD line), it's reasonable to assume that Barker's $50 million stash is only diversifying, with no end in sight.</p><strong
