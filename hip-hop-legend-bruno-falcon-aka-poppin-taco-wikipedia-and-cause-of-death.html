He was the choreographer for the dangerous tour.</p><p>Also, he was praised for his appearance in films including Moonwalker, Thumbelina, Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey, and others.

He is also known as King Snake. He also played the lead in the 1984 film BREAKIN’ and later made an appearance in Michael Jackson’s Smooth Criminal.</p><h2 id=bruno-death-cause><span class=ez-toc-section id=bruno-death-cause></span> Bruno Death Cause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pop N Taco’s mostly known as Bruno Falcon reportedly passed away from the disease at age 58 in 2022, one month after his birthday, in Los Angeles, California, USA, where he was born on June 10, 1964.</p><p>Many people believe that this artist’s unexpected and sudden death, which occurred when he was only in his 50s, was due to an illness and not to any natural causes but no means of any pure causes is revealed yet.</p><p>It is yet unsure of Bruno Falcon’s actual cause of death because, other than the confirmation of his passing, no additional information has been made public via digital media as of yet. With time and investigation, his real cause of passing away will be out as fans are eager to know about it.</p><p>When he was last seen, he was showing off a variety of dance moves and other characteristic moves that he had taught to the late singer MJ.</p><h2 id=falcon-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death><span class=ez-toc-section id=falcon-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death></span> Falcon Net Worth At The Time Of His Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Worthy Celebs, Falcon has an estimated net worth of $700,000. He acquired this wealth from his work as a professional dancer and actor.</p><p>Bruno also had the chance to collaborate with Michael Jackson, a great dancer, in his music video, which helped Falcon advance in his profession.</p><p>In the Bob Rafelson-directed 1983 movie Lionel Richie: All Night Long (All Night), Bruno Falcon made his acting debut as a break dancer. His first acting job was in the 1984 movie Breakin’ as the lead dancer of the group Electro Rock 1.</p><p>In addition, Jane Simpson’s 1984 music video for Chaka Khan’s “I Feel for You,” which features Bruno, was created.</p><p>Due to impressive involvement in his career field, he seems to have amassed his quality financial worth. As he is no more now, his earnings may now belong to his family members.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCZpXqpu89mo56flaOxbq7RrqWoZZaWuaS7zWaYpJldpbyxvMinZK2Zk6R6uLXKoqeenJmWeqK6w2aamq2jmnqwsoydnJqsmGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-did-john-oliver-wife-kate-norley-overcome-injuries-from-traumatic-bike-accident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did John Oliver's Wife, Kate Norley, Overcome Her Injuries From Her Traumatic Bike Accident">&larr;
