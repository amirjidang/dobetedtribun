They can sing, act, and even run successful businesses. These stars are rare, which is why they can make a fortune while on top, and one example of a star like this is Jessica Simpson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer has made headlines for a variety of reasons, including <a href=#>her love life</a>, her <a href=#>younger years in entertainment</a>, and even elements of <a href=#>her family life</a>. Simpson has also made headlines for her ability to make money.</p><p>The star is worth an estimated $200 million, so let's see how she made it happen!</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-was-a-pop-star>Jessica Simpson Was A Pop Star</h2><p>During the late 1990s, Jessica Simpson burst onto the pop scene looking to cement her place alongside Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. While she was never as big as either, Simpson had a heck of a music career, and she was able to get the ball rolling on her massive net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her debut album, Sweet Kisses, was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA, and sales were greatly boosted thanks to having multiple songs hit the top 40 on the Billboard Charts. From there, the singer was able to keep her success in music rolling.</p><p>So, just how successful was Jessica Simpson in the music sphere?</p><p>"She has sold 20 million records worldwide. Simpson has a total of records sales in Australia of more than 426,000 copies and was ranked in the # 113 on the 1000 artists chart of ARIA Music Decade Charts (1980–2010). In 2009, Billboard named Simpson as the 95th overall best Artists of the Decade. Simpson also was ranked at number 86 on Billboard 200 Artists, solely based on album sales," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Vogue</a> reports.</p><p>Simpson had a solid music career, and she was able to flip this into some success on reality TV and in the world of film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jessica Simpson Talks Being Sexualized While Growing Up In The Church</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-also-acted-and-starred-on-reality-tv>She Also Acted And Starred On Reality TV</h2><p>Jessica Simpson was truly ahead of the pack, as she was one of the first and most infamous celebrities to have a reality show. It mainly functions as a time capsule from a lost era these days, but at the time, her reality show with her ex, Nick Lachey, was pretty popular.</p><p>Outside of her reality show, Simpson had plenty of other TV roles over time. She's been on shows like That '70s Show, The Twilight Zone, Punk'd, Project Runway, and a number of shows where she simply appeared as herself.</p><p>In the film world, Simpson was putting in plenty of work. She landed roles in movies like The Master of Disguise, The Dukes of Hazard, Employee of the Month, and even The Love Guru. She was never a prolific actress, but those are some fun credits for any performer to have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, the world of entertainment has been great for Jessica Simpson, and it's been rather lucrative, as well. That said, the star amassed her $200 million thanks largely to a separate venture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Nick Lachey And Jessica Simpson Get Divorced?

Simpson sold a majority stake in the company in 2015, which was bringing in $1 billion in annual retail sales at the time, Forbes reported. In 2020, Simpson debuted a memoir entitled “Open Book” that reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The site also noted that "Jessica Simpson Collection, a fashion and accessories brand that was bringing in $1 billion in annual sales as early as 2014 — enough that she never has to sing another note again."</p><p>Yeah, if you thought it was music that got the job done, think again. Her lifestyle brand was a major hit, and it net her a life changing amount of money.</p><p>Simpson's brand changed hands, which is how she made a ton of cash. However, due to the pandemic, the company owning the brand was forced to sell. Thanks to a contractual clause, Simpson was able to get her brand.</p><p>"In August 2021 Jessica, working with an investment bank to help with financing, paid $65 million to reacquire her brand with a bankruptcy judge's approval," Celebrity Net Worth writes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ashlee Or Jessica Simpson: Which Sister Has The Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica Simpson is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's amazing to see what the pop star has been able to accomplish since first becoming a smash hit in music. Just imagine how high she can take this net worth now that she has the brand back.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Jessica Simpson’s Weight Loss May Be More Tragic Than Fans Believe</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dn7K0v8icmGarmaK9tLvNZpurp6aaeqmx0WalnqxdrLyzwMdmrKln</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./todd-julie-chrisleys-kids-quotes-about-their-parents-in-prison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Todd, Julie Chrisley's Kids Quotes About Their Parents in Prison">&larr;
