He lacked confidence and taking part in something like martial arts gave him a big self-confidence boost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>He would dip into the world of comedy</a> at the start, something he didn't anticipate. Soon enough, he would find his way back into the world of martial arts, becoming an announcer for the UFC.</p><p>We can safely say things worked out quite nicely for Rogan, as the UFC took over the world of sports, while his status would skyrocket.</p><p>Rogan thrived in the world of MMA and <a href=#>he would later take his talents to the world of podcasting</a>. Again, it was another venture he thrived in, <a href=#>signing a deal worth millions alongside Spotify.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Ray Romano Failing This Gig Changed Joe Rogan's Career</a></span></p><p>Fans love his work ethic, along with the relentless attitude he has when he's inside the gym. Millions of fans listen to his motivational talks prior to training.</p><p>However, fans have always wondered about Rogan's physique, especially when it comes to his abdominal area.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's extremely lean but maintains a stomach. Doctors and fans have chimed in on the matter, while Rogan himself would also address the question.</p><h2 id=his-scheduled-is-packed-with-workouts>His Scheduled Is Packed With Workouts</h2><p>One thing is for sure, Rogan isn't short on workouts. As of Sunday, <a href=#>he's planning out his entire workout week</a>, which is filled with different skills.</p><p>"I schedule my workouts every Sunday, I schedule everything that I'm going to do during the week."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Joe Rogan Workout Photos That’ll Make You Want To Hit The Gym</a></span></p><p>"I say 'I have to do yoga two times this week' and 'I have to lift weights three times this week' and 'I have to run twice this week.' And however I fit that in, I fit that in. But I owe those things so I have to get those things in. The only exceptions are injuries and sickness. That's the schedule."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"On top of that, there are other things that I enjoy doing like kickboxing and Jiu-Jitsu. I work those in when I can."</p><p>Just reading that schedule out loud sounds extremely exhausting... Along with that, when he's really pushing hard, Rogan makes sure the diet is very clean.</p><p>"The diet is pretty strict in terms of no bread, very few carbs, no sugar, no bullshit. Healthy food, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of game meat, mostly wild game.</p><p>"I take vitamin supplements every day. I take multivitamins, I take probiotics, I take vitamin B12 and D."</p><p>With all that work, most would assume Rogan has a flat stomach. However, over the years, fans are noticing that isn't exactly the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-amp-doctors-chime-in-on-the-gut>Fans & Doctors Chime In On The Gut</h2><p>Known as the "bubble gut," everyone seems to be chiming in on the matter. According to the YouTuber, More Plates More Dates, <a href=#>it might have to do with Rogan being insulin resistant.</a></p><p>"As insulin resistance starts to set in, their chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to nerve damage in the limbs. The more nerve damage the limbs get, the more atrophied the look, and as well, as more distended the stomach will look."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Joe Rogan's Height Just Got Trolled In Sky-Writing, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Fans are also taking part in the conversation via platforms such as Quora. Some believe <a href=#>over-developed abdominal muscles</a> might be another issue for Rogan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think it’s mainly built-up muscle mass around his core muscles, his ab muscles are quite defined - this is great for jiu-jitsu and weight-training, but less visually attractive on males."</p><p>In addition, Rogan has admitted to using enhancements in the past, which can also cause water retention, along with things like spiking insulin levels.</p><p>Rogan would speak out about the matter, giving a much simpler reason to his stomach.</p><h2 id=rogan-blames-it-on-poor-eating-habits>Rogan Blames It On Poor Eating Habits</h2><p>According to Rogan, the answer is a simple one, having one too many plates of pasta. The podcast host admitted, <a href=#>he does stray from the diet at times.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When Saturday came around, I ate Italian food, I had pasta. Then yesterday I went to Disneyland so I went way off the diet."</p><p>“I had ice cream and ate all kinds of s***** food and I was getting back pains and knee pains which went away when I was on diet.”</p><p>Perhaps this could have factored in, however, it seems to be an ongoing issue for the last couple of years. Fans have also noticed a similar situation with Dwayne The Rock Johnson.</p><p>Nonetheless, it does not deter their hard work and willingness to be better. Rogan is a freak in the gym</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Fans Slam Joe Rogan For Saying 'Wokeness Silences Straight White Men' On His $100M Podcast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsButs6eZKunl5a7brXNZqqhmaCaeqPB02akmqGeqa6qutJmmGafpal6o7HLpbBmr5WetKnAjKCYoqZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./willem-dafoe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Willem Dafoe Alive or Dead?
