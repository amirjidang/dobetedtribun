Starring Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs, Shannen Doherty, and Rose McGowan as the four leads over the course of the series, the show follows the story of the Halliwell sisters—modern-day witches in San Francisco.</p><p>Since the end of the show, each cast member has gone on to do different things. They’ve continued to build their acting careers, some of them diving into the world of movies while others explored other genres of television. Check out every cast member of Charmed’s net worth below.</p><h2 id=alyssa-milano-10-million>Alyssa Milano: $10 Million</h2><p>Phoebe Halliwell begins as the youngest of the Charmed sisters, but after losing Prue and finding Paige, she moves into the role of middle sister. With her powers of premonition and empathy, her passionate romances, and her chic style, Phoebe is arguably one of the most popular characters on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alyssa Milano, who portrayed Phoebe for the show’s eight-season run, has a net worth of approximately $10 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. She’s appeared in other acting projects since the end of Charmed and has a strong following on social media.</p><h2 id=holly-marie-combs-14-million>Holly Marie Combs: $14 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Holly Marie Combs</a> played Piper, the middle-turned eldest of the Charmed Ones. Piper’s power is arguably the coolest—who wouldn’t want the ability to freeze time at any awkward moment? Piper’s enduring relationship with Leo also serves as one of the main drivers of the show.</p><p>Combs appeared on other TV shows since finishing up on Charmed, including on the drama series Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;where she played Ella Montgomery. She has also attended various Comic-Con events over the years, much to the delight of adoring Charmed&nbsp;fans. These have added to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million net worth</a>.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan-18-million>Rose McGowan: $18 Million</h2><p>Rose McGowan didn’t come into the Charmed world until it was already a hit show with a sizeable fan base. She first graced our screens in the third season to play Paige Matthews, the long-lost half-sister of Prue, Piper, and Phoebe. Being half a witch and half a whitelighter, Paige has the ability to orb and call for items.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Female Singers In 2019</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Famous Births and Deaths</a>, McGowan has a net worth of $18 million. Other sources state that her net worth actually sits somewhere around $6 million. Either way, she’s doing pretty well!</p><h2 id=shannen-doherty-10-million>Shannen Doherty: $10 Million</h2><p>For the first three seasons of the show, Shannen Doherty played the wise and grounded eldest Halliwell sister, Prue. After the Season Three finale, though, fans never get to see her play Prue again. For reasons that still aren’t entirely clear, Doherty left the show and McGowan came on.</p><p>As of 2019, Doherty is worth about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>. She has also appeared with her former cast-mate Combs at various Comic-Con events and has starred in other TV shows, including 90210. Doherty is reported to be good friends with Combs, even after all this time.</p><h2 id=brian-krause-500k>Brian Krause: $500K</h2><p>Leo Wyatt is one of those characters that has set all of us up for disappointment. No husband is ever going to be quite as angelic as Leo and that’s been a hard fact to swallow after religiously watching the show for years! Leo appears less in the later seasons due to <a href=#>budgeting issues</a>, but we’re so glad that he returns for the epic finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Crown's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Brian Krause, who portrayed Leo, is said to be worth around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$500,000</a>. Like Holly Marie Combs and Shannen Doherty, he has also appeared at Comic-Con events to connect with die-hard Charmed&nbsp;fans.</p><h2 id=julian-mcmahon-16-million>Julian McMahon: $16 Million</h2><p>Not to (literally) play the devil’s advocate here, but Julian McMahon is one of the reasons why we fell in love with Charmed. He gives up so much for Phoebe during their relationship, and the only reason he turns evil again in Season Four is because he plots with the Seer to save the Charmed Ones from the Hollow! We love almost all of Phoebe’s boyfriends, but Cole Turner is our favorite.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Note</a>, Julian McMahon has a net worth of $16 million. The Australian-born actor is famous for appearing on Nip/Tuck between 2003 and 2010.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-55-million>Kaley Cuoco: $55 Million</h2><p>It isn’t until the last days of Charmed&nbsp;that Kaley Cuoco arrives as Billie, the apprentice witch who first learns from the Charmed Ones before being turned against them by her sister Christie. Those were the days when Cuoco was mostly unknown. Today, she is worth $55 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cuoco achieved worldwide fame through her role of Penny on the hit TV show The Big Bang Theory, which came to an end in 2019. We can’t wait to see what other projects she’ll undertake in the future!</p><h2 id=drew-fuller-1-5-million>Drew Fuller: $1.5 Million</h2><p>Drew Fuller doesn’t appear in Charmed until the end of the fifth season&nbsp;when his character Chris mysteriously shows up in the manor to help the sisters defeat the titans and save the world. In Season Six, it’s revealed that Chris is actually Piper and Leo’s son—a fact that was written into the script after Holly Marie Combs fell pregnant.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;states that Drew Fuller has a net worth of about $1.5 million. After Charmed, he appeared in several other projects, including Army Wives, and the TV movie Perfect on Paper.</p><h2 id=dorian-gregory-2-million>Dorian Gregory: $2 Million</h2><p>Though he’s just a regular human with no magic powers, Darryl Morris is a strong part of the Charmed family. Over the years, he uses his position as a detective to help the sisters out in endless ways. They wouldn’t have survived without Darryl! Dorian Gregory, who played Darryl, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth $2 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is most well-known for his role on Charmed, but he has a list of other acting credits under his name. These include the TV series Family Time, and the TV series Without a Trace.</p><h2 id=eric-dane-7-million>Eric Dane: $7 Million</h2><p>Eric Dane only appears on the show during Seasons Five and Six, where he plays Phoebe’s boss and boyfriend Jason Dean. Although we will forever worship Phoebe and Cole, we still love Phoebe and Jason together. Their relationship seems to be able to defy all the odds until he finds out that she’s a witch.</p><p>Dane is famous for his work on Grey’s Anatomy, as well as for his appearances in movies such as Marley and Me and Valentine’s Day. His net worth is currently listed at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$7 million</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is Us: Every Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqa3RppydZZOWwLV5wJyrqKqjYq6kwNGeqqydo2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./georgia-napolitano-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Georgia Napolitanos biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr;
