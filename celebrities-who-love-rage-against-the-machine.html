It's not necessarily as popular as pop or rap music, and neither does it have the same amount of big-name stars as the other mainstream genres. However, its fan base is full of avid men and women who have stuck with the genre for decades now. <a href=#>An example of this would be Jason Momoa</a> who can actually play rock-related instruments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there are many popular metal bands nowadays, most fans still listen to a lot of its older songs. Hailing all the way back to the 60s, Ozzy Osbourne is seen as the founder of metal music. <a href=#>Ozzy himself doesn't even like the term "Heavy Metal"</a>, in an ironic twist. Since those early days, metal bands like Rage Against The Machine have taken over. A rap metal band from California that formed in the '90s, their influence cannot be denied.</p><p>Rage Against The Machine fans typically consist of everyday people, but some celebrities enjoy their music as well. Some musicians have shown their love for the band, and even some non-musicians as well.</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-is-a-hardcore-fan-of-rage-against-the-machine><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Guy Fieri Is A Hardcore Fan Of Rage Against The Machine</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/80141C0D-7DC8-4000-9799-3E343DBF3DD0.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri is a notorious metal fan</a>.

He was caught rocking out at multiple RATM concerts from their 2022 reunion and found himself on the band's TikTok page (yes, Rage Against The Machine is on TikTok). He was seen with his son Hunter at a Rage concert in Raleigh, so he isn't the only Fieri who's a confirmed fan.</p><p>Of course, many fans on social media took notice and posted memes about the charade. One video that went viral on Youtube had the title "Rage Against Flavortown".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sleeping-with-sirens-are-hardcore-fans-of-rage-against-the-machine><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sleeping With Sirens Are Hardcore Fans Of Rage Against The Machine</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sleeping-with-sirens.jpg><p>Sleeping With Sirens is a metal band just like Rage Against The Machine. Unlike Rage, they come from Florida and became famous in the early 2010s. Some of their biggest songs are "If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn", "Kick Me" and "If You Can't Hang".</p><p>Guitarist Nick Martin tweeted out his love for the band when their reunion was announced on social media. He seemed static that their hiatus was finally over, tweeting "RATM is back, too?". Of course, he had to add a gif to the tweet for comedic emphasis.</p><p>Singer Kellin Quinn recently worked with rock-based musicians Travis Barker and Machine Gun Kelly on the song "Love Race", two musicians who recently covered Rage Against The Machine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly-and-travis-barker-had-an-iconic-cover-of-this-rage-against-the-machine-song><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Machine Gun Kelly And Travis Barker Had An Iconic Cover Of This Rage Against The Machine Song</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/_how-much-has-machine-gun-kelly-s-guitarist-sophie-llyod-made-from-being-in-his-band_.jpg><p>MGK and Travis Barker gave their famous cover of Rage Against The Machine's "Killing In The Name" back in 2020. The cover was a response to the BLM movement that was taking place during the time. Many fans of the original song actually liked their rendition, including the timing of the song's release.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Sophie Lloyd And How Did She Become Machine Gun Kelly's Guitar Player?</a></span></p><p>It shouldn't be much of a surprise that the two looked up to RATM. Travis Barker is one of the biggest rockstars walking on the planet due to his impeccable drumming for Blink-182. While MGK is a tried-and-true rapper, his background is definitely rock and roll. Beyond the rock-inspired fashion and haircuts, he told Complex that he loved Guns 'n' Roses and Blink-182 growing up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denzel-curry-also-had-an-iconic-cover-of-a-rage-against-the-machine-song><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Denzel Curry Also Had An Iconic Cover Of A Rage Against The Machine Song</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/denzel-curry.jpg><p>While MGK and Travis Barker had an excellent and inspired RATM cover, a different musician had a Rage cover that completely blew fans away.</p><p>Rapper Denzel Curry, whose younger audience doesn't really cross over with Rage's older fanbase, covered "Bull's On Parade" for Triple J's Like A Version series. However, numerous metalheads came out on various social media platforms to applaud the underground rapper for his intense take on an already angry song.</p><h2 id=public-enemy-were-such-hardcore-fans-of-rage-against-the-machine-that-they-formed-prophets-of-rage><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Public Enemy Were Such Hardcore Fans Of Rage Against The Machine That They Formed Prophets Of Rage</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rage-against-the-machine.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Denzel Curry and Machine Gun Kelly aren't the only rappers to adore Rage Against The Machine. The revolutionary 90s rap group Public Enemy looked up to a music group that came out after them, which is a really impressive feat on Rage's part.</p><p>Public Enemy primarily consisted of Chuck D and Flava Flav, although Flav has transitioned to a reality show career over the years. The two toured with Rage on a few occasions before Chuck formed a supergroup with the band. While frontman Zach de la Rocha didn't join in on the fun, the rest of the original Rage band did, forming Prophets of Rage with Chuck back in 2016.</p><h2 id=system-of-a-down-were-hardcore-fans-of-rage-against-the-machine><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>System Of A Down Were Hardcore Fans Of Rage Against The Machine</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/serj-tankian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>System of a Down was another huge metal band from the same time period as Rage Against The Machine. The band incorporated some rap elements, although not to the same extent as RATM. However, they were just as political as Rage, with subjects based around the ongoing wars in the Middle East at the time.</p><p>Seeing as SOAD came out nearly a decade after RATM, it's not hard to see how they were inspired by them. Frontman Serj Tankian has confessed his love for Rage in interviews with Tom Morello. The two have played together during concerts, and have covered songs such as Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train".</p><h2 id=weird-al-yankovic-parodied-rage-against-the-machine-quite-a-few-times><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Weird Al Yankovic Parodied Rage Against The Machine Quite A Few Times</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-(24).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Musicians have had a range of reactions to Weird Al's bizarre covers of their music. <a href=#>Nirvana had a unique reaction to Weird Al's parody</a> of their music.

He didn't parody one song in particular, but really the whole sound of their band. The songs "Straight Outta Lynwood" and "Angry White Boy Polka" also featured covers of RATM in some form, even if it was only brief.</p><p>Weird Al never parodies music he doesn't like, which is part of his charm.</p><h2 id=paul-ryan-was-a-hardcore-fan-of-rage-against-the-machine><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paul Ryan Was A Hardcore Fan Of Rage Against The Machine</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paul-ryan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's generally seen as odd</a> that politician Paul Ryan would like Rage Against The Machine.

Rolling Stone has reported about Paul's love for Rage, and the former House representative has talked about it in interviews.</p><p>However, Paul did tell the New York Times that while he does love the music, he's never been the biggest fan of their lyrics.
