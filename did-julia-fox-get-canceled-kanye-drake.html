This wouldn't be the first time Julia Fox shocked the Internet with her actions or statements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she was already an established Hollywood actress prior to dating Kanye West, Julia Fox's short-lived relationship with one of the high-profile celebrities certainly brought her into the spotlight significantly. Still, the media seems to be more interested in her personal life and controversial actions rather than in her work.</p><p>Throughout the years, Julia Fox stepped on the toes of some big names in Hollywood, showing everyone that she likes to speak up her mind. While some fans adore her for her raw talent and fearless attitude, others are calling for her to be canceled due to her behavior.</p><h2 id=julia-fox-39-s-personal-life-takes-the-spotlight-away-from-her-career>Julia Fox's Personal Life Takes The Spotlight Away From Her Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar51960326.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julia Fox is certainly not shy. She is an outspoken celebrity who enjoys experimenting with looks, and speaking her mind on social media or in her personal life, even if her opinions are controversial and sometimes unpopular.</p><p>Julia Fox has made waves in the entertainment industry; however, it seems that more attention is directed toward the controversies rather than on her work. Not too many people know about her breakout role as Julia in the 2019 crime thriller Uncut Gems, or being Scarlet in PVT Chat in which she played a dominatrix.</p><p>However, headlines including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fun facts about Julia Fox</a> are certainly crowding the Internet. In this case, though, Julia Fox's personal life blends with her role in PVT Chat since she used to work as a dominatrix when she was 18 years old in real life.</p><p>As a result of having more attention to these kinds of details rather than to her work, there is a surrounding buzz of her personal life that often overshadows her acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Raps About Pete Davidson, Kim Kardashian And Julia Fox In His Song 'Easy'</a></span></p><p>Even her art is sometimes controversial. In 2017, she created a multimedia exhibition that featured paintings with her own blood on silk. Also, when she dated Kanye West one year after he and Kim Kardashian parted ways, she gained even more attention from the media and the public.</p><p>One month later, Julia Fox and Kanye West's love story suddenly ended because of different schedules among other reasons. Still, she didn't want to be remembered as Kanye West's ex-girlfriend, so <a href=#>she wrote a book, starred and directed in a few movies</a>, and said that she dated Kanye to do a favor to Kim Kardashian.</p><p>From her high-profile relationship with Kanye West to her bold fashion choices and provocative social media posts, Julia is no stranger to controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-fox-39-s-drake-date-revelation-shocked-fans>Julia Fox's Drake Date Revelation Shocked Fans</h2><p>Julia Fox is back in the headlines once again, and this time it's because of her revelation about a date she went on with rapper Drake. While she denied the rumors of any romance going on, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she confirmed that she went out with Drake but it was more like "friends hanging out"</a>.</p><p>This brief fling happened before she dated Kanye West for about two months, and Julia Fox made sure to mention that Kanye West was aware of this night out with Drake when they started dating.</p><p>Still, it didn't really seem like "friends hanging out", considering that she needed to let her then-boyfriend know about this encounter.</p><p>Also, Drake apparently showered her with very expensive gifts and visited Julia Fox while she was working.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-69.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since it's clear that Julia Fox is somehow stirring controversies, or simply getting involved in them, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her description of her date with Drake didn't sit well with many fans</a>. Julia Fox focused on the material things, including flying in a private jet and getting "some Chanel bags."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Julia Fox Has Remained Unphased By The Drama Between Kanye And Kim</a></span></p><p>"So basically, the best part of the date wasn't him," summarized one fan. People were left disappointed with her description since Julia Fox didn't focus on describing her feelings throughout the date, or even cute moments, but chose to highlight the spotlight of the date, namely the material possessions.</p><p>Others went even further and said that she is more interested in "superficial aspects" rather than in a true love story. Slowly, the conversation turned to Julia Fox always being involved in controversies, and fans saying that "everything I know about Julia Fox is against my will."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-fox-often-gets-in-controversial-feuds>Julia Fox Often Gets In Controversial Feuds</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Julia-Fox-Opens-Up-On-Addiction-Struggle-After-Azealia-Banks-Feud.jpg><p>While Julia Fox's dating life is always a hot topic of discussion, her feuds also get a lot of attention. Even if <a href=#>her Instagram dispute with Azealia Banks wasn't exactly started by Julia Fox</a>, there were certainly some things that attracted attention. Azealia Banks claimed that Julia Fox and Kanye West's relationship wasn't about love, but a pretty strategic PR stunt.</p><p>Also, Azealia Banks went on by saying that Kanye West probably ended things with Julia Fox because she was a "liability," calling her out on her struggles with addiction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did The Cast Of 'Uncut Gems' Actually Like Julia Fox?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Julia Fox responded on the addiction aspect, she brought up Kanye West's feelings for Kim Kardashian as one of the reasons for their breakup. Also, even when the discussion isn't about her, Julia Fox jumps into controversies.</p><p>During the defamation case between Amber Heard and Johnny Deep, <a href=#>she went to social media to say that even if Amber Heard hit Johnny Deep, she wasn't the abusive one</a> because "she had no power." This didn't sit well with many people who thought she was subtly stating that men can't be victims of abuse.</p><p>Julia Fox may be a talented actress, but her controversial choices and statements often overshadow her work. From high-profile relationships to feuds with other celebrities, Julia Fox is always at the center of a media storm. While some fans appreciate her raw talent and fearless attitude, others call for her to be canceled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn8KttcBmnaiwXZyytXnCmqWcnZyasW63wKewnmWUp66ssY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./inside-paris-hilton-and-carter-reums-sons-1st-birthday-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Paris Hilton and Carter Reum's Son's 1st Birthday Party">&larr;
