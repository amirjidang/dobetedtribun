Many people ask questions about the selection process every year and even more as soon as the winners are announced at the award ceremonies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably, the Oscars are the most prestigious film awards on the planet, and many fans have claimed that other awards simply copy the nomination and winners lists of the Oscars when coming up with their award shows. This is the reason the actors who win Oscars win the same awards&nbsp;at numerous other award shows, regardless of what the fans thought about the winners.</p><p>The one individual who has learned how to win the hearts of the members of the Academy is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meryl Streep</a>&nbsp;since she has received 21 Academy Awards nominations. No other actor or actress has had as many nominations, and this is evidence there's something she knows about the Oscars other people don't.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a> has never been nominated for an Academy Award, despite being one of the most popular and highest-paid actors in Hollywood. One of the reasons for this is the films he appears in since they're not considered Oscar-worthy, something that's sure to change in the next few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although many actors deserve an Oscar, Johnson belongs&nbsp;at the top 10 list of the ones who are most likely to win the award in the next few years. Here are 15 reasons why Johnson should win the award in the next three years.</p><h2 id=his-acting-range-has-really-grown><strong>His Acting Range Has Really Grown</strong></h2><p>One of the best things about Dwayne Johnson is his ability to play any role and make his character shine. With a background in wrestling, he started his new career in films but at first, showed off nothing but his fighting skills and landed roles that any muscle head would have pulled off because very little acting skill was required.</p><p>Many actors fall into the trap of only fitting certain roles and they end up suffering when they can't find acting gigs or when someone new comes along and beats them at their only game. Johnson will excel in action, science fiction, thriller, disaster, crime, comedy, and even animation, among other genres.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to win an Oscar, an actor has to be versatile, meaning he can take any role and make it better than what the writers expected. In the next three years, Dwayne Johnson's sure to get a role where the Academy will have no option but to nominate him for an Oscar, which he'll win.</p><h2 id=he-has-the-power-to-transform-a-franchise><strong>He Has The Power To Transform A Franchise</strong></h2><p>The people who usually get the most award nominations are the ones who appear in a lot of great films, and Dwayne Johnson has that covered. Although everything has its advantages and disadvantages, most actors dream of getting notable roles in successful film franchises, because this means they usually don't have to struggle to look for many acting jobs.</p><p>Some people have described Johnson as "franchise Viagra" because of his ability to attract audiences to theaters simply because he will be in a movie. For instance, we can all agree that his inclusion in the <a href=#>Fast and Furious franchise</a> has had some significant impact on its revenue. It's first four films grossed less than $500 million, but the three films he has been part of have made over $800 million from the domestic market alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although many factors contribute towards a film franchise's success, the characters who stand out obviously attract everyone's attention including the Academy.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-genuinely-good-guy-and-everyone-loves-him><strong>He's A Genuinely Good Guy And Everyone Loves Him</strong></h2><p>When ordinary people become famous for their talents and start making a lot of money from it, they start thinking that they're better than everyone else and end up treating the fans who made them famous like trash.</p><p>This can be the story of so many celebrities in Hollywood, but not even a word of that would be true if it were applied to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Many people who have interacted with him have described him as a genuinely fun and approachable guy, who is always willing and ready to take selfies with random fans.</p><p>Johnson is super-talented, but he's one of the most down-to-earth people you will ever meet, which is one of the main reasons he has so many die-hard fans. The Academy is listening to what people say these days, one of the reasons the awards are so diverse. Therefore, when people say they want Johnson, they will give in to their demands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-can-sing><strong>He Can Sing</strong></h2><p>Most of the actors who make it big in Hollywood are those who have more to offer, in terms of their abilities, compared to the ones who are only good in one thing. The actors who make it to the big screen from Broadway usually do well because most of them develop their acting, singing, and dancing skills for years and they perform them in front of a live audience.</p><p>Since he was a wrestler, Johnson hasn't had as much training as other actors in Hollywood have, which is why it was such a surprise to learn just how great of a singer he was when we watched <a href=#>Moana</a>. Johnson has not had so many voice roles in animated films either, but just how well he played Maui is an assurance he will get more in future.</p><p>For his role in Moana, Johnson received four award nominations, from which he won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Fantasy Movie Actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-really-funny><strong>He's Really Funny</strong></h2><p>As if it is not awesome enough to have a perfect smile, giant muscles, a handsome face, and a lovable personality, Dwayne 'The Rock" Johnson completes the package by being a hilarious person. He does not have problems fitting into comedy roles because he is a funny person in real life.</p><p>Watching his interviews is always a treat because he makes the audience crack up. He is always posting funny spoofs on social media where he is having a good time. He even makes fun of his cohosts and his friends, all in good fun.</p><p>Even when he was a wrestler, he came up with funny and catchy phrases that we still remember to date including "can you smell … what... The Rock… is cooking?" He has also become famous for funny phrases and calling out people who do&nbsp;not&nbsp;laugh by cutting them off and screaming, "It doesn’t matter" in their face. One of these days, he will be a star of a mega comedy feature and the Academy will have no choice but to nominate him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-role-in-the-film-skyscraper><strong>His Role In The Film Skyscraper</strong></h2><p>News of The Rock's new 2018 film,&nbsp;Skyscraper, is already making crazy rounds&nbsp;on social media since people started sharing funny memes from the promotional poster. The poster shows him in midair trying to make a jump from a crane into a burning building to save his family. According to science geeks, there is no way he can make the jump hence the memes have concluded he'll die, even before they see the film.</p><p>The story revolves around a hostage rescue-team leader who is also a U.S. war veteran named Will Ford (The Rock), who is retired and works as a security assessor for skyscrapers. On one assignment, he finds the tallest and what is meant to be the safest building on fire and he is framed for it. He must run, he must find the guilty party, and he must rescue his family from the fire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This seems like a high-powered action movie that is going to have people on the edge of their seats. We are hoping he has polished his action-movie acting skills and since in the film, his character lost a leg while on a military assignment, he's likely to bag an Oscar with this one.</p><h2 id=his-muscles-deserve-an-oscar-all-on-their-own><strong>His Muscles Deserve An Oscar All On Their Own</strong></h2><p>The Rock is an all-around gym freak who lives to bulk up in order to become a real-life Hulk. During his training for Fast and Furious 8, he gained a whopping 22 pounds of muscle and was in a super strong state&nbsp;when he played the role of Mitch Buchannan in Baywatch.</p><p>Standing at 6'5'' and weighing 262 pounds, Johnson has an amazing body. The 45-year-old has a strict diet of protein, fats, carbs, and veggies that are well planned by his nutritional experts' team. On a normal day, he eats seven times, knocking back chicken, fish, egg whites, filet mignon, broccoli, oatmeal, baked potatoes, cream of rice, salads, fruit, and complex carbs. For you to eat this much food, you'd be ingesting around 6000 calories in a day!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He starts working out at 3:50&nbsp;a.m. so his muscles deserve an Oscar on their own. All this hard work will definitely pay off when he gets recognition and wins an Academy Award soon.</p><h2 id=his-troubled-past-can-work-in-his-favor><strong>His Troubled Past Can Work In His Favor</strong></h2><p>People love a redemption story because it's so inspiring. As much as Dwayne Johnson is a role model to many kids today, he wasn't always such a stand-up citizen. Before he became a wrestler, he was passionate about football and he played the game in college.</p><p>Johnson reveals he was always getting into fights and in trouble for stealing when he was young, and before he was seventeen years old, he had been arrested eight to nine times. He also confessed he suffered from depression after being cut from The Calgary Stampedes back in 1995.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his troubles as a young man, he turned his life around by finding a new passion for professional wrestling. He later built his career in acting and has been doing well ever since. His personal story of redemption is an inspiration to many people across the world and makes for perfect Oscar bait. If he continues on this positive track, he will definitely attract a golden script that the Academy will look forward to awarding him the statue.</p><h2 id=his-love-life-has-no-drama><strong>His Love Life Has No Drama</strong></h2><p>Many superstars today thrive in the limelight because of their constant drama. However, fans are getting tired of people rising to fame because of drama. The good thing about The Rock is that his fame is as a result of his hard work, wit, charm, and pure talent.</p><p>Some celebrities have switched and ditched spouses so many times we can hardly keep up, but The Rock is mature enough to keep his love life drama free. He was married to Dany Garcia from 1997 to 2007. They had a drama-free split and he started dating Lauren Hashian soon after the divorce. They have a child together and he has announced they're expecting a second one this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's focused on his career and family and he uses his influence and wealth to change lives of those around him and inspire the world at large. This kind of focus is what wins Academy Awards.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-risk-taker><strong>He's A Risk-Taker</strong></h2><p>The Academy Awards recognize talent, wit, charm, and dedication. They also award exemplary performance, which can only be achieved if the actor is a risk taker. The Rock has been known to take huge risks in order to achieve anything he wants, and this makes him the perfect Academy Award contender.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson has been quoted numerous times in is interviews saying that taking risks is what has helped him rise to fame. If he did not take a chance at wrestling when his football career ended, he would not have become such a fan sensation. He gained a good following in the wrestling field and he took another risk when he tried acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rock admits he didn't have many fans in his earlier features, which some critics even said were so bad he should have stuck to wrestling. However, he ignored them, took many more chances, and now he is one of the most sought-after actors.</p><p>When he first got into acting, he only took roles that required bulky characters such as his roles in The Scorpion King and The Rundown. However, he took risks and tried funny roles, romantic roles, and even geeky roles, all of which he has excelled in. This expands his fan base and now we can't wait to see what he will do next.</p><h2 id=his-wrestling-background-is-a-huge-plus><strong>His Wrestling Background Is A Huge Plus</strong></h2><p>Some mainstream media does not air wrestling since they consider it too violent and vulgar for family viewership, which is one of the reasons Johnson had to look for another avenue&nbsp;to become as great as he is today. The WWE incorporates a lot of acting in comparison to the actual fighting, which makes it so different and popular compared to other wrestling shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, since Johnson must have polished his acting and fighting skills when he was at the WWE, he can do his own fight scenes and most of his own stunts.</p><p>The Rock has already shown serious skills in his fight scenes. He killed it in The Rundown fight scene where he fought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Clarke Duncan</a> and had epic fight scenes with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Statham</a> in Furious 7 and The Fate of the Furious, just to mention a few. We are optimistic that one of these days, an epic fight scene will win him an Academy Award nomination.</p><h2 id=he-can-play-an-underdog-making-a-comeback><strong>He Can Play An Underdog Making A Comeback</strong></h2><p>Something about an underdog becoming victorious at the end of a movie appeals to people, probably because viewers love movies that inspire them, give them hope, and encourage them to fight to the end. The feature is even better when the movie is based on a true story since most actors who bag Academy Awards get recognition for representing real-life people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the best movies about underdogs include Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, 8-Mile, Slumdog Millionaire, Money ball, The Longest yard, among others. If Johnson will come across a good script with the potential for a moving underdog story, he will definitely bag an Oscar.</p><p>Since his acting has greatly improved over the years, the only thing standing between him and an Oscar is a great script. Since we've loved what he has done with franchises and movie retakes such as The Fast and the Furious, Baywatch, and Jumanji. We have faith he would do well with a good director, a good script, and a good underdog story.</p><h2 id=no-one-else-can-play-a-cop-like-he-can><strong>No One Else Can Play A Cop Like He Can</strong></h2><p>As much as we know he's just acting, when Dwayne Johnson gets to play a cop, we end up believing he's a real cop. The interesting thing here's that when he was younger, the 16-year-old Dwayne was always mistaken for an undercover cop in high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A school photo of him at 16 years of age has been doing rounds on social media as a funny spoof because he looks even older at sixteen than he does at 40. He confessed he attended multiple high schools because he was expelled numerous times. His mature physique and the tendency to hang out in bars made his peers and teachers mistake him for an undercover cop.</p><p>Fast forward to today and nobody can play cop like he can. We look forward to the day he will get a great cop script that will earn him an Oscar. He was phenomenal in Central Intelligence and Walking Tall and we'd expect nothing but outstanding in a future film. If they give him a badge, a gun, and a bad guy to chase, he will end up with an Oscar for sure.</p><h2 id=a-criminal-role-will-undoubtedly-win-him-the-award><strong>A Criminal Role Will Undoubtedly Win Him The&nbsp;Award</strong></h2><p>Dwayne Johnson is currently one of the most loved people in Hollywood. His career is at its peak and we cannot wait to see what he does next. We know him for his heroic movie roles such as in&nbsp;San Andreas where he saves his family from fatal disaster. Then he played the role of Mitch Buchannon, the leader of a lifesavers team who saves the beach from a powerful drug lord in Baywatch. He then played Maui in Moana, a legendary demigod who helps to save a Polynesian village among many others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson has perfected the role of the good heroic guy who saves everybody at the end with his massive muscles. Imagine how good a movie would be if he was the villain? He would be unstoppable. His body and fighting skills as a criminal is franchise material for sure because the cops would never catch him.</p><p>If Johnson lands a role where he becomes a bad guy he will easily win an Oscar since it would be a complete U-turn from what we expect of him.</p><h2 id=he-could-lose-his-muscles-and-regain-them-for-a-role><strong>He Could Lose His Muscles And Regain Them For A Role</strong></h2><p>Can you imagine what would happen if The Rock lost his muscles and then regained them for a role? It would be one of the most amazing films ever made. Stars who radically lose weight to fit into roles get attention from the Academy and their bets of winning an Oscar improve significantly.</p><p>We've seen actors who go through drastic changes for a role receive Oscars. These actors include Christian Bale in The Fighter, Natalie Portman in Black Swan, and Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice amongst many others. Watching the transformation leaves viewers in awe, and it attracts multiple award nominations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Extreme physical transformations always seem to highlight the actors' seriousness in his or her craft, and his or her willingness to do anything to do justice to a role. The Rock has proven he can bulk up for a role, so, can he starve himself and bulk up again to win an Oscar?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlKyuurrEZqmom5tit7C0zaymp2Wimq60u82sZJ%2BtpKq%2FpnnOrJqaql2stq%2B6xKtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-ways-to-score-a-sugar-mama.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Ways To Score A Sugar Mama">&larr;
