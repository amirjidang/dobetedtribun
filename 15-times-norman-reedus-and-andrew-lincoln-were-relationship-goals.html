Everyone is obsessed with The Walking Dead for different reasons; maybe you tune in every week in hopes that one-eyed CORAL will kick more butt, or maybe Glenn was your thing (sorry, too soon?), but for all fans there seems to be one constant love: the bromance between Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon. Starting off as foe, eventually becoming friends, and eventually calling each other family, the story of Rick x Daryl is a fan favorite for countless reasons. The bromance between the two best zombie-killers in the world&nbsp;gives us LIFE. Here are 15 times it has been proven that Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus are the definition of relationship goals both on and off screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-show-affection-in-public><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>When they show affection in public</span></h2><p>We need to take a moment of silence and thank the fandom gods for two leading men whose characters not only have love for each other on screen, but who genuinely love each other in real life as well. When you're watching the Walking Dead thinking "just kiss already!" well, think no more, because Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln are on it. They're never afraid to show their affection for one another, whether it be during promos, interviews, or even on set! We could speculate about what happens WAY behind the scenes, but, alas, it would only be speculation. If you really want to imagine the possibilities, there’s endless fanfiction to fulfill your Rick x Daryl dreams (just be warned before you read, fanfiction does NOT mess around).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whenever-they-pull-pranks-on-each-other><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Whenever they pull pranks on each other</span></h2><p>Ah, the infamous glitter battle. Even when poor Andy tried to get Norman back for putting glitter in his car vents, he STILL ended up with glitter all over his beard. And look at how much Norman is enjoying it (tbh, we thought it was a hilarious backfire too). Norman is a known prankster, but Andrew&nbsp;has gotten his share of jabs in as well. He scared Norman with a zombie impersonator during an interview, and once he&nbsp;put Norman's bike onto a boat with a sex doll sitting on top and shoved it out into the water. Now that's elaborate! These two goofs have no boundaries when it comes to getting each other back, we can't wait to see what crazy thing they think up next!</p><h2 id=because-they-both-understand-the-intensity-of-their-relationship><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Because they both understand the intensity of their relationship</span></h2><p>With great bromance, comes great responsibility, and Andrew Lincoln's wife has had to learn this all too well over the past years. Both Andrew and Norman say they talk all the time, and Norman even sends Andrew fan art and memes shipping the relationship between Daryl and Rick. Funny thing is, Andrew has made it known that his wife controls his phone and social media because he’s not the best with technology. Does that mean that when Norman sends picture of Rick x Daryl in the bathtub together, that Andrew’s wife must see it first? Sure does. Andrew may joke around that his wife is getting concerned, but we call BS! No woman in her right mind would have the slightest problem with this loving pair of pals, and anyone who does, well, you have a couple million fangirls to answer to, and that’s a dangerous path to go down!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whenever-they-re-badass-together-on-screen><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Whenever they're badass together on screen</span></h2><p>As great as Andrew and Norman's&nbsp;real world relationship is, there's just something about seeing them kick ass on screen as Rick and Daryl. Though Rick Grimes has always been the "hero" of the show, the leader of the pack who does his best to keep everyone together and do what’s right for his group, Daryl has really come into his own too over the past few seasons, becoming a stronger leader and friend than he ever was before. The dynamic between the two leading men has gone from cautious acquaintances to trusting allies, and it’s obvious that they both work off of each other’s strengths, and they’ve both literally saved each other’s asses more than once. Without Rick there is no Daryl, and without Daryl there is no Rick, so keep that in mind showrunners… or else we riot!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whenever-the-rick-x-daryl-fandom-is-just-too-clever><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Whenever the Rick x Daryl fandom is just too&nbsp;clever</span></h2><p>The fans of Rick x Daryl are plentiful, that's for sure, but who knew they were so creative? There seems to be no end to the memes, posts, and fan art that are dedicated to everyone's favorite Walking Dead couple (sorry Richonne shippers, it is what it is). Even Norman Reedus himself admits to sending Andrew Lincoln fan art that he sees online, and we're starting to wish Andrew would get up on technology so he can start doing the same! But, for now we’ll settle for the fact that Daryl Dixon, crossbow, muscular arms and all, is a real life fangirl. Knowing that Norman Reedus himself is one of the biggest Rick x Daryl shippers is literally all we need to get through the day.</p><h2 id=because-they-ve-come-so-far-since-season-1><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Because they've come so far since Season 1</span></h2><p>Think back, it's 2010, a simpler time, and we&nbsp;are only just being introduced to the new show The Walking Dead. A fresh-faced cast tried to figure out their new post-apocalypse existence, and obviously emotions are running high. We meet Rick Grimes, the do-good police officer on a mission to find and protect his family. When you're Rick Grimes, sometimes you have to make the hard decisions, and one of those decisions involved accidentally leaving&nbsp;Merle, Daryl's brother, behind on a mission. Let's just say that Daryl was not too fond of Rick when they first met, in fact, Daryl downright hated him for what he did to Merle. Fast forward to the present, it's 2017, Rick and Daryl have been through hell and back together more than once, and they now have a new understanding of who they are, and have found brothers in each other. If that's not the most romantic, beautiful, and REAL love story you've ever heard, well, you're lying.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-their-personalities-come-out-in-full-force><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>When&nbsp;their personalities come out in full force</span></h2><p>When it comes to TV shows and the characters we fall in love with, it’s often hard to separate reality from fiction. Thankfully both Andrew and Norman are fantastic on and off screen, but one thing we find adorable is how genuinely different their personalities are from their characters. Unlike Daryl Dixon, who is a man of few words, often speaking primarily in deep stares, Norman Reedus is an outgoing goofball who always has something smart and usually sexually suggestive to say. When it comes to Andrew Lincoln, his most obvious difference to Rick Grimes is the British accent, which TBH we think makes him that much better. It does throw us sometimes to see a well-mannered, British version of the American zombie-killing sheriff, but we love him all the same. Watching these two interact, especially seeing Andy’s reactions to Norman’s suggestive humor, is comedy gold!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=because-they-re-both-obsessed-with-jeffrey-dean-morgan><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Because they're both obsessed with Jeffrey Dean Morgan</span></h2><p>Just look at those loving stares directed at Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Rick and Daryl may not have the best relationship with Negan in the Walking Dead, in fact they’re basically mortal enemies literally trying to kill each other at any chance they get, but outside of the show Andrew, Norman, and JDM are best buds. There are very few people lucky enough to be considered to join this bromance, Danai Gurira has been selected a few times, but by far our favorite addition to Rickyl is Jeffrey Dean Morgan, one of the most beautiful and charming men in the world. We wonder what the dynamic on set is like, having to fake torture/almost kill one of your best friends. Are you guys okay? We’re here for you!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-got-together-for-a-good-cause><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>When they got together for a good cause</span></h2><p>Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln decided to team up for charity and support Red Nose Day with the rest of the Walking Dead crew. Wearing red robes and drinking milkshakes (come on, this fanfiction writes itself), these two took their naturally witty personalities and partnered with a good cause to create a special parody of the Walking Dead in order to support children’s charities worldwide. If there’s anything better than these two together, it’s these two together using their star power to support those in need. Their hearts are as big as their walker kill count, maybe bigger, and we’re not sure what we’ve done to deserve these pure and perfect cinnamon rolls, but we are forever thankful. This isn’t the first charity they have supported, and knowing them it won’t be the last. Keep up the good work Rickyl!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-went-on-a-lunch-date-like-any-other-couple><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>When they went on a lunch date like&nbsp;any other couple</span></h2><p>We often wonder how much of Andy and Norman's lives are taken up by the Walking Dead, not only is it their job as actors, but with all the promo, fan events, and interviews, you'd think they might get sick of talking about the show every once in a while. Well, SURPRISE, just like us, Andrew and Norman just can’t get enough of the walking dead. We love seeing them take time to relax and laugh with each other, especially since we’ve had some serious lack of Rick x Daryl in this past season. On this lunch date, Norman is clearly trying to convince Andy that the crossbow is the best weapon in the show, and Andy is all like “yeah, you sure do look good with that crossbow!” Same, Andy, same.</p><h2 id=when-they-had-this-moment-and-we-all-died-a-little-inside><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When they had this moment, and we all died a little inside</span></h2><p>Daryl and Rick's relationship has gone through a lot in this series, but specifically in the past 2 seasons, Daryl has really gotten the short end of the stick.&nbsp;Even when he escaped from Negan's compound, he still had to be extra careful to hide himself from the Saviors who have literally been ripping places apart to look for him and bring him back. The hug scene between Rick and Daryl, otherwise known as the best scene ever filmed in modern day TV, was full of a lot of feelings for both the characters and fans. We had been waiting a LONG time to see this reunion, but what we didn't realize is that we would cry like babies in the process. This hug just proves what we already knew: Rick and Daryl have serious love for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-held-hands-on-the-red-carpet><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>When they held hands on the red carpet</span></h2><p>We need to talk about Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln looking dapper AF in their suits and holding hands on the red carpet. Three years have been added onto our lives, our crops are thriving, our grades are up, and all is well in the world. Have you ever seen such a vision? Never! These two are pros at what they do, and they really know how to bring it when it comes to dressing up. We're used to seeing Andrew and Norman covered in either sweat, dirt, walker blood, their friends blood, their own blood, or&nbsp;many times all of the above. It's refreshing to see them all cleaned up and ready to take on the world.&nbsp;Whether it's killing walkers or killing the fashion game, these two simply KILL IT! Now go slay that red carpet like always, boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=because-they-both-have-serious-love-for-their-cast-mates><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Because they&nbsp;both have serious love for their cast mates</span></h2><p>We are fully aware that without the Walking Dead we would not have the most glorious bromance to ever grace the world, and if there's anyone Andrew and Norman love as much as each other, it's the Walking Dead cast. They are all like a big family who support and love each other, and we're pretty sure they all ship Rick x Daryl just as much as anyone else. Seeing all of these guys&nbsp;smile and laugh together is a nice reminder that everyone isn't actually dying, and all is right in the world. Jeffrey Dean Morgan even said that Andrew is a lot like Rick when it comes to the real cast, being their leader of the group and always trying to bring&nbsp;everyone together. Awwww!</p><h2 id=whenever-they-re-on-set-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Whenever they're on set together</span></h2><p>You'll be hard pressed to find a picture of Norman and Andrew on set that isn't of them goofing off and laughing with each other. We're not sure how the cast and crew on the set of the Walking Dead get any work done&nbsp;while these two put their bromance on display for all to see. All in favor of a Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon spin-off series? They could literally just walk down dirt roads with their weapons in hand and grimaces on their faces for an hour a week and sure as hell we would tune in every time. Actually... that's kind of what this show has turned into anyways. Thank god this past episode was&nbsp;packed with action AND all of our favorite characters. We were getting antsy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-they-say-i-love-you-and-truly-mean-it><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>When they say "I love you" and truly mean it</span></h2><p>The one thing that really takes this Rick x Daryl bromance to the next level, is the fact that they quite literally&nbsp;say that they love each other, like ALL the time. They both love singing each other's praises, and just can't seem to talk enough about one another. One of the most important parts of a relationship is truly appreciating your partner, their personality, their talents, the good, the bad, all of it. These two leading men are always complimenting each other, Andrew talks a lot about Norman's acting skills because Norman is so humble about it.&nbsp;That's just what true friends do, they boost you up and give you confidence. Andy and Norman don't fake the love for the cameras, thank the fandom gods, their love is REAL!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWknrqmv4ynpqulkaN6s7HEnaysZZGjsW6tzZ2pnq9dobavr86lpWavlaeybr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2aeqJmcqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adam-brody-biography-age-height-family-wife-movies-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Brody Biography, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Movies and Net Worth">&larr;
