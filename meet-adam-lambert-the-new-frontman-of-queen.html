There's more to this story than just hits and high notes; Lambert's net worth reflects his journey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from American Idol finalist to rock legend</a>, and his projects with Queen have left audiences clamoring for more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, music enthusiasts, let's meet the man who's not just keeping the Queen's legacy alive – he's also turning it into a modern-day phenomenon.</p><h2 id=a-brief-chronicle-of-ldquo-glambert-rdquo>A Brief Chronicle of “Glambert”</h2><p>Let's rewind to January 29, 1982, when Leila and Eber Lambert welcomed this rock sensation in Indianapolis, Indiana. Adam's arrival heralded many remarkable future achievements, and his partial Norwegian descent and Romanian-Jewish heritage meant his upbringing was rooted in those cultures.</p><p>Alongside his brother Neil, Adam was raised in the Jewish faith, and at the tender age of nine, he kicked off his artistic journey with the Metropolitan Educational Theater network, beginning some serious <a href=#>acting and vocal coaching</a> not long after that.</p><p>Glambert (as he is popularly called) immersed himself in theater, choir, and jazz band in his high school years with appearances in productions such as Hello, Dolly! and Grease. He subsequently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attended California State University, Fullerton</a> to study musical theater – but dropped out after five weeks to pursue his dreams in Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After rumors made the rounds on the internet at the height of his stint on American Idol, Lambert openly confirmed that he is gay during a Rolling Stone cover interview. He has been in relationships with the Finnish entertainment reporter and reality TV personality Sauli Koskinen, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">model Javi Costa Polo</a>.</p><h2 id=adam-lambert-rsquo-s-musical-genesis>Adam Lambert’s Musical Genesis</h2><p>Every great journey begins with a single step, and for Lambert, that <a href=#>journey into the musical world</a> began with a series of remarkable milestones. At just 19, he performed on a cruise ship for 10 months with Anita Mann Productions, and subsequently ventured into the world of light opera in Orange County, California.</p><p>At 21, Lambert signed on to a European tour of Hair, marking his first taste of the spotlight. He also shared the stage with Val Kilmer in The Ten Commandments: The Musical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Notably, during these early years, he was part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the underground rock band, The Citizen Vein</a>, and explored the realms of demo singing and session musicianship with a compilation of his 2005 recordings released as Take One in 2009.</p><p>Amid these projects, a defining moment occurred when Adam took the stage at the auditions for <a href=#>the eighth season of American Idol</a>, singing both Rock With You and Bohemian Rhapsody. This move marked the start of a spectacular musical odyssey that would captivate audiences worldwide, as he went on to appear in the final.</p><p>Lambert's debut album, For Your Entertainment, released in 2009, marked the beginning of his notable discography, featuring hits like Whataya Want from Me. His career skyrocketed, leading to acclaimed tours, collaborations with renowned artists, and multiple awards – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including a Grammy nomination</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meet Maria Sharapova: The Former Grand Slam Winner</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-adam-lambert-a-rock-spectacle>Queen + Adam Lambert: A Rock Spectacle</h2><p>The Queen + Adam Lambert collaboration is a dynamic musical partnership between the enduring <a href=#>British rock band Queen</a>, represented by Brian May and Roger Taylor, and the electrifying American vocalist Adam Lambert. This collaboration was forged somewhat by chance in 2009, when Queen members May and Taylor appeared on American Idol – where Lambert was a contestant.</p><p>Rather than replace <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the iconic Freddie Mercury</a>, Lambert joined Queen as a featured artist alongside the active band members. Their synergy was first showcased during a performance of We Are the Champions, with Lambert and Kris Allen on American Idol.</p><p>This collaboration has since blossomed into a <a href=#>global musical phenomenon</a>. Queen + Adam Lambert embarked on a series of tours, starting with the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour in 2014 and 2015, which took them across North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and South America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their resounding success led to The Rhapsody Tour, featuring performances in North America, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Europe. Even amidst the challenges posed by <a href=#>the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the partnership persisted, producing the charity single You Are the Champions, and the electrifying album Live Around the World.</p><p>With Brian May's guitar prowess, Roger Taylor's drumming, and Adam Lambert's sensational vocals, complemented by accomplished musicians like Spike Edney, Neil Fairclough, and Tyler Warren, Queen + Adam Lambert continues to captivate audiences worldwide with their <a href=#>spectacular rock performances</a>.</p><h2 id=adam-rsquo-s-acting-endorsement-deals-and-other-ventures>Adam’s Acting, Endorsement Deals, And Other Ventures</h2><p>Adam Lambert, with a net worth estimated at $45 million, has extended his career well beyond the world of music, successfully venturing into acting, brand endorsement, and other profitable avenues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While his acting journey began with his film debut in The Ten Commandments: The Musical in 2006 (where he portrayed the character of Joshua) it was in the television world that Lambert truly made his mark. Notably, he appeared on <a href=#>the popular TV series</a>Glee from 2013 to 2014, taking on the role of Elliot "Starchild" Gilbert for five episodes.</p><p>His performance on the popular series showcased his acting prowess, and earned him acclaim from both fans and critics. In addition to his acting career, Lambert has secured <a href=#>lucrative endorsement deals</a>, capitalizing on his charismatic and unique image – and his popularity has made him a sought-after brand ambassador.</p><p>Furthermore, his partnership with Queen as their frontman has not only been artistically fulfilling, but also financially rewarding. The collaborative projects, concerts, and worldwide tours with Queen have not only <a href=#>solidified his status as a music icon</a> but have also significantly contributed to his net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meet Rook: Machine Gun Kelly's Celebrity Drummer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-lambert-rsquo-s-awards-and-recognitions>Adam Lambert’s Awards And Recognitions</h2><p>Throughout his career, Adam Lambert has garnered <a href=#>numerous awards and recognitions</a>, solidifying his position as a music icon.

Lambert's impact on the music scene was further acknowledged at the British LGBT Awards in 2015, where he was honored with the Music Icon Award.</p><p>Lambert's collaboration with Queen also received acclaim, as they were named "Band of the Year" at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards in 2014. In 2017, their tour was recognized as the Tour of the Year at the same awards ceremony. Additionally, Lambert's <a href=#>involvement in the LGBTQ+ community</a> was acknowledged at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2013, where he won the Outstanding Music Artist award.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqisMCmZKWZnZeys8CMrZ%2BeZZ6axG6y0ailraWRo3qwsoyqrJ6dnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meri Brown News - Us Weekly">&larr;
