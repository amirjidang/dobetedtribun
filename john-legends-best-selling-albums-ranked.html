With a clear vision of music success from a young age, they boy named John Roger Stephens graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in English, but he had no intentions of <a href=#>becoming the next J.K Rowling.</a> Instead, he launched into his music career and soon rubbed shoulders with rap legend Kanye West, and was signed to his label as a singer. As his "Legendary sound" continued to make waves, he proved to be a class act with his combination of singing and piano playing which set him apart from most other singers. There's really no denying his impact on music, so here are John Legend's best-selling albums, ranked.</p><h2 id=once-again---2-5-million-copies>Once Again - 2.5 Million Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years into his professional career as a musician and Legend had already been hired by Lauren Hill to play the piano on her timeless song, Everything is Everything&nbsp;from her 1998 album The Miseducation of Lauren Hill. Still signed to Kanye's G.O.O.D Music label, he released once again in October 2006 with a slew of other <a href=#>artists who he collaborated with, such as Kanye West himself</a>, will.i.am, Estelle Swaray, and Stevie Wonder. The album was a success, selling 231,000 in its first week, and in total album copies, it sold 2.5 million The album even peaked at No. 1 with the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums worldwide charts.</p><h2 id=get-lifted---2-432-million-copies>Get Lifted - 2.432 Million Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Under the guidance of Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams (G.O.O.D) label, John Legend became the first artist on the rapper/producer's start-up label, and West had big plans for his classic, old-school, "legendary" sound. Combined with his raspy, ex-choirboy voice and the piano-inclusive act, Legend's closest comparison in that era of R&B was the <a href=#>talented Alicia Keys</a>. With West's vision and ultimate belief in Legend's "Spirit Music," his first debut album was released in December 2004 titled Get Lifted. Acc<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ording to Chaospin</a>, the album peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. To date, Get Lifted has sold over 6 million copies worldwide since its release.</p><h2 id=love-in-the-future---1-015-million-copies>Love In The Future - 1.015 Million Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released in September 2013, Legend's fourth studio album Love In The Future&nbsp;didn't fail to deliver, peaking at No. 2 on the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart as well as the UK Official Albums Chart. It went on to earn Gold Certification with the RIAA, ARIA, and Music Canada while selling over 1 million copies in eight countries worldwide, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Best Selling Albums</a>. Legend's merging of a jazzy, soulful era of R&B and the new school era of rap and hip hop can be seen in the guest appearances on the album, which include the <a href=#>Maybach Music mogul Rick Ross</a>, Stacy Barthe, and the British singer/songwriter, Seal. The single All of Me from the album reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Billboard Smooth Jazz Songs and is still considered a classic to this day.</p><h2 id=evolver---590-000-copies>Evolver - 590,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Again released by Kanye's G.O.O.D Music in collaboration with Sony Music Entertainment was John Legend's third studio album, titled Evolver. While this album didn't sell as many copies as his previous albums, peaking at 590,000 copies, it still managed to produce some unforgettable singles such as Everybody Knows, Green Light featuring <a href=#>OutKast member Andre 3000</a>, and If You're Out There. The album as a whole also peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it Legend's third consecutive album to make such an achievement. In addition to Andre 3000, guest appearances on the album also included reggae star, Buju Banton, Kanye West, Estelle, and singer/actress Brandy.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Mariah Carey's Highest-Grossing Albums Of All Time, Ranked</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=darkness-and-light---40-000-copies>Darkness And Light - 40,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Darkness and Light marked <a href=#>John Legend's</a> fifth and final studio album under Kanye's G.O.O.D Music label as well as the end of his five-album contract. Released by Columbia Records in 2016, it's also one of his most recent albums. The album peaked at No. 5 on the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and also made it to No. 14 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Upon release, the album sold 26,000 copies in the first week and 40,000 units in Canada. Despite finding greater success in his previous releases, Legend also had to contend with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">newer school of R&B, such as dancer, actor, and singer Chris Brown</a> who released his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seventh studio album, Royalty</a>, one year earlier, and sold 1 million units.</p><h2 id=legendary-christmas---20-000-copies>Legendary Christmas - 20,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it may not have come anywhere close to selling the 15 million album copies achieved by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas album in 1994</a>, John Legend's Legendary Christmas made enough of a splash to be nominated for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards. It consisted of 14 songs, two of which were featured on by Esperanza Spalding and <a href=#>the musical icon Stevie Wonder</a>. The album also debuted at No. 26 on the US Billboard 200 chart and eventually rose to No. 22, with a total of 19,000 pure album sales. The album was also re-released in 2019 with four additional tracks.</p><h2 id=bigger-love---13-200-copies>Bigger Love - 13,200 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many may argue that Legend's most recent album, Bigger Love, released in 2020, has seen the lowest album sales of his career because of his split from Kanye West's music recording label. But the album release may have been largely <a href=#>compromised by the Covid-19 pandemic</a> which rocked the world around the same time. According to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Showbiz 411,</a> Bigger Love sold 13,200 CDs and downloads, but with additional streaming counted in, it would raise its equivalent to 33,000 copies. Despite a few collaborations from Jhene Aiko, rising Jamaican artist Koffee, and American musician Gary Clark Jr., a lack of touring and album promotion may be the cause for low album sales.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it was recognized by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rated R&B</a> on its 30 Best R&B Albums of 2020 list.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Way John Legend Earns And Spends His $80 Million Fortune</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Choaspin</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Selling Albums</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Showbiz411</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNZqOen5WjsbR5wZ6qrWWjmrmttc2gZJqkkqq6tHnRmqWknZRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-sosnovske-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-140525-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Sosnovske Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
