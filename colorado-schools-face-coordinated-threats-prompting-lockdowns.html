The FBI reported that no evidence of a “specific and credible threat” had been found. Certain schools received false emergency calls in alphabetical order.</p><p>The FBI said they have nothing to suggest a significant danger exists, although threats were made to organizations and institutions throughout the state. Swatting is when someone makes a fictitious call to law enforcement with an actual address attached.</p><p>Fortunately, neither Denver Public Schools nor Jeffco Public Schools experienced an incident like swatting on that day.</p><p>Across Colorado on Wednesday, many schools went into lockdown or secure mode following several phone threats to districts from one end of the state to the other.&nbsp;</p><p>These districts consisted of Boulder, Englewood, and Aspen. All lockdowns were navigated without incident, and each school was relieved within minutes.</p><p>None of these threats have been deemed authentic by the State Office of Emergency Management; nevertheless, they are doing their best to manage the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>They have declared that “The State Watch Center staff continues to monitor and communicate with local law enforcement to coordinate information related to today’s school incidents” to ensure the safety of everyone involved.</p><p>The authorities in Denver, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement agencies, are currently investigating a series of threats made across the state.&nbsp;</p><p>While they have not yet identified the calls’ source, officials believe the threats were coordinated.</p><p>Schools across the state have implemented safety protocols in response to the threats, such as secure mode and lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>Secure mode involves locking the exterior doors of the building and preventing anyone from entering or leaving while classroom activities continue as usual.&nbsp;</p><p>Lockdowns, however, include locking all doors, including those to classrooms, and stopping all activities.</p><p>Some of the threatening calls reportedly featured the sounds of gunfire in the background, adding to the already tense situation.</p><p>The first known threat was made to the Alamosa School District at 8:24 a.m. Shortly after, at 8:28 a.m., the Aspen School District received a threat, followed by a call to the Aurora School District at 8:30 a.m.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the school threats, a report was made to Denver 911 of a threat to the FBI Denver at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>Law enforcement officials have assured the public that they are taking the threats seriously and are using all available resources to investigate them.&nbsp;</p><p>They have also urged the public to remain vigilant and immediately report any suspicious activity or individuals to law enforcement.</p><p>In times like these, schools need to have safety protocols in place to ensure the safety of their students and staff. Secure mode and lockdowns are protocols that can be implemented when there is a potential risk or threat in the area.</p><p>The phrase “locks, lights, out of sight” is often associated with a lockdown, as it reminds teachers and students to lock the doors, turn off the lights, and stay out of sight.</p><p>While it is understandable that people may feel anxious and scared in such situations, it is essential to trust the authorities and their ability to handle the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity or individuals, we can all do our part to ensure the safety of our communities.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzqWmq5mUpHq0r8eopqWrXZuupLGMnKaoqpSeu6LAxJ1kraCimq61v4ypqailoKm2r7OMpaaco5SkxK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cristina-ferguson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cristina Ferguson (Tony Fergusons Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp;">&larr;
