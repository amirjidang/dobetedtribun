However, there have been rare instances of artists producing hit songs for the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> industry in a matter of minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just consider how much you could accomplish in 30 minutes, from getting a manicure to reading a book to working out your entire body. Nowhere on our to-do lists did we find "write a hit song for a massive fan base," but then again, we're no <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</strong></p><p>Swift has stated that the legendary We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together was written in under 25 minutes. The following eight tracks were completed in less time than it would take to have takeout brought to your door.</p><p><strong>This list is just a small sample of artists who have been able to write hit songs in 30 minutes or less. Other artists with this amazing talent include: Guns 'N Roses with 'Sweet Child O' Mine,' Eminem with 'Rap God,' Meghan Trainor with "Lips Are Movin," Charlie Puth with "See You Again," Lizzo with "Cuz I Love You," Sia with "Chandelier," and of course, Mariah Carey with "All I Want for Christmas."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>As more artists become inspired and write their songs in 30 minutes or less, the list will be updated.

"I wrote it in, like, half an hour — the lyrics, anyway. I wrote all the lyrics and took them to the studio, and my producer was like, 'Yeah, this is cool.' We worked on that and on two other songs on the EP in a week, and just did a little bit every day."</p><p>They had no idea that their affirmation that, "Yeah, this is cool" would be the century's greatest understatement. A 15-year-old vocalist who was still relatively unknown in the world wrote a song in 30 minutes that would eventually launch her to success.

"It's been unbelievable the way the song has crossed over into the mainstream.

I actually wrote it on guitar, and I was at school at the time. I actually find this song really emotional now because so much has happened since I wrote it, and it's been like 11 years since I wrote it. So my whole career has happened, and it's one of my favorites still, to this day," <a href=#>she told Billboard.</a></p><p>The singer-songwriter was solely responsible for Hometown Glory. She supposedly wrote it while she was only 16 years old, making it the first song she ever composed. And for it to make a splash with 10 minutes of writing?
