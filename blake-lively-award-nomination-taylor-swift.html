The video received over 32 million views on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Blake Lively Posts Taylor Swift Reference Following Video Release</a></span></p><p>The music video has been nominated for ‘video of the year’ at the Academy of Country Music. The day after <a href=#>Lively’s directorial debut of Swift’s music video</a>, she took to Instagram with a behind-the scenes-photo from the video with a caption that was all too familiar amongst Taylor Swift’s fans. ‘Not a lot going on at the moment’ was the same caption Swift used on a selfie posted to Instagram three months prior to releasing her surprise album, Folklore in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The nomination could earn Blake Lively an accolade for her role as director and producer. The ACM Awards air March 7th 2022, but the duo is already celebrating the nomination. Blake Lively posted to her Instagram story with a GIF that read ‘I am freaking out.’</p><p>Ryan Reynolds, Lively’s husband, also took to his Instagram story to share his excitement for the two. As did Taylor Swift herself, congratulating Lively, Miles, and Keleigh Teller who appear in the video as bride and groom.</p><h2 id=39-i-bet-you-think-about-me-39-was-a-masterpiece>'I Bet You Think About Me' Was A Masterpiece</h2><p>The music video depicts a wedding day and Taylor Swift plays the former girlfriend of the groom played by Miles Teller. The video starts out with Teller's character practicing his vows in a mirror. Taylor interacts with guests at the wedding and destroys the cake, knocking the groom figure off it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift is dressed in all red for the entire video besides a scene later in the video when she is wearing a wedding dress that later turns all red. This detail works so well because of the Red re-recording. Lively did a great job representing the album through the video.</p><p>Taylor is seen destroying the wedding cake and constantly popping up in precious moments like the wedding speeches. She gifts the bride with a red scarf that references her song ‘All Too Well,’ which was also re-released on Red (Taylor’s Version). Another immaculate detail.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Easter Eggs We Discovered in Taylor Swift's Music Videos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift is big about using Easter eggs in her music videos, which leaves fans to speculate on what her upcoming projects will be. Lively did the same thing when she attended an SNL after-party with Swift wearing a red heart-shaped ring that could be seen in the 'I Bet You Think About Me' music video. In the video, when Swift destroys the cake, she can be seen wearing the same heart-shaped ring Lively wore.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-blake-lively-39-s-friendship>Taylor Swift And Blake Lively's Friendship</h2><p>Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have had a wonderful friendship since 2015. Although it started with fans thinking Lively shaded Swift on Instagram. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively posted a L’oreal Campaign to her Instagra</a>m with a caption that fans thought was a dig at Taylor Swift’s ‘Bad Blood’ music video. She quickly spoke out to say what a total Swiftie she actually is. She posted a picture of her husband Ryan Reynolds' family with Taylor Swift backstage at the 1989 tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two have gotten closer with every year that passes. <a href=#>Lively has shown major support of Swift’s surprise seventh album Folklore</a>. They have both publicly supported each other's careers.</p><p>In 2015, Swift and Lively met up in Australia and spent the day together at the Warner Bros. Movie World theme park in Queensland. ​​Over the years, they have spent the Fourth of July, New Year’s Eve, and Taylor’s 30th birthday together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's New Single Has Another Hidden Connection to Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively</a></span></p><p>Most recently, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds showed up to support Taylor Swift’s performance at Saturday Night Live back in November. This performance was an important one, it was Swift’s first time performing her re-release of 'All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)' from the re-recording of Red (Taylor’s Version) that Lively was a part of with the track 'I Bet You Think About Me.' Around the same time (the month prior) Taylor even tagged along with Lively and Reynolds as they went trick or treating with their kids in New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-and-ryan-reynold-39-s-involvement-in-swift-39-s-music>Blake Lively and Ryan Reynold's Involvement in Swift's Music</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift has even featured Lively and Reynolds children in her music</a>.
