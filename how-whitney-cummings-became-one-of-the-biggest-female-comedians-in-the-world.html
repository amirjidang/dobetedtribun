While Cummings modeled in the early years of her career post-college, she developed a love for comedy before working at various clubs. <a href=#>Her breakout role occurred through MTV</a>, and she worked in minor roles on television shows while continuing her career as a steady stand-up comedian. She was inspired to become a show creator by appearing in comedy roasts and doing hour-long television specials. She produced various shows under her name, the most popular being <i>2 Broke Girls</i>, establishing her as <a href=#>one of the most successful female comedians</a>.</p><p>As a co-creator and producer, Whitney Cummings makes millions every year from syndication fees and royalties, which have amassed her a $30 million fortune. Along with the show, she is also a successful author and a podcaster with a series that invites various artists from Hollywood to join her for a chat. From working at local comedy clubs to becoming a successful showrunner, let’s look at how Whitney Cummings became one of the biggest female comedians in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-natural-stand-up-comedian>A Natural Stand-Up Comedian</h2><p>Whitney Cummings was only five years old when her parents divorced, and she lived with her aunt in Virginia until turning twelve.

After getting discovered by MTV producers, Cummings starred in <i>Punk’d</i> in <a href=#>2004 alongside Ashton Kutcher</a>. While working in small-budget movies, she slowly continued her career as a stand-up comedian.

In 2010, she had her first one-hour television special, Whitney<i> Cummings: Moneyshot</i>, and even went on the Rescue Me Comedy Tour with Denis Leary. The following year, she produced and co-created her TV show <i>Whitney</i> based on a semi-fictional version of herself which ran for two seasons until 2013. The show aired thirty-eight episodes during its run before ending.</p><p>The same year that <i>Whitney</i> was released, Cummings was also on her way to releasing her second show, a comedy sitcom <i>2 Broke Girls</i> on CBS. Amidst the male-centric lineup of shows on the network, <i>2 Broke Girls</i> starring Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs, was a new idea conceptualized from Cummings’ early days as a struggling comedian. The show revolved around two waitresses and their struggles of being broke. The show became a wild success and ran for six consecutive seasons with famous cameos from stars such as Kim Kardashian, RuPaul, Martha Stewart, and Lindsay Lohan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Cummings made her directorial debut with the comedy movie <i>The Female Brain</i> in 2017. Around the same time, <i>2 Broke Girls</i> ended its six-season 138-episode run. It has become a steady income source for the co-creator as TBS won the rights for $1.7 million per episode, a then-record, and gave $235.6 million for its first syndication run. Cummings will make $50 million steadily over the years through the royalties.</p><h2 id=sharing-love-and-laughter-everywhere>Sharing Love And Laughter Everywhere</h2><p>With her comedy specials, television shows, and directorial debut, Whitney Cummings also became a published author when she released the book <i>I'm Fine…And Other Lies</i> in 2011, publishing short stories about her life.

In 2019, her fourth comedy special, <i>Can I Touch It</i>? released on Netflix, and she began her podcast <i>Good For You</i>, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, Cummings released an audiobook of her first hour-long special, <i>Whitney Cummings: Money Shot</i>.
