Unfortunately for Curry, however, it is hard to imagine how he wouldn't be distracted by what has been happening in his personal life over the last couple of years.</p><p>After more than three decades of marriage and bringing up a pair of fascinating basketball superstar sons, Sonya and Dell Curry announced plans to divorce in 2021. With his parents' divorce in the news, that would be distracting enough for Steph, but things only got worse from there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Stephen Curry Fans Blame Kid Cudi For Almost Breaking His Ankle</a></span></p><p>First, the fact that so many fans labeled Steph's mom a MILF after her divorce was announced must have seemed weird enough for him. From there, the fact that those same fans were open with <a href=# rel=nofollow>their disappointment when they learned his mom was dating someone new</a> is even more outrageous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, however, the weirdest news was still to come. After all, once his mom and dad both started dating new people, the details of the former couple's new relationships garnered headlines as well as mockery.</p><h2 id=why-did-steph-curry-39-s-parents-get-divorced>Why Did Steph Curry's Parents Get Divorced?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-21-at-1-52-36-pm.png><p>When a couple has been married for 33 years and then they get divorced, it is only natural for people to wonder what went wrong. However, in those situations there often is three versions of events since each person involved has their own story and then there is the truth.</p><p>Once Dell and Sonya Curry's marriage fell apart, the couple initially put out a joint statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We are so thankful for all the many blessings and successes! We stay committed to and supportive of our children and grandchildren and will remain on connected paths. We ask that our privacy be respected and prayer for our family as we move forward"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Who Is Steph Curry's Daughter Riley Elizabeth, And Where Does Her Name Come From?</a></span></p><p>Despite their joint statement, it wasn't long after that there were reports about Sonya and Dell's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">different versions of the events that led to their divorce</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According to TMZ, Sonya was the one who filed for divorce</a> and she accused Dell of "marital misconduct".</p><p>Dell later responded with a legal filing claiming that Sonya had been unfaithful and lied about her conduct. Furthermore, Dell argued that he shouldn't have to pay alimony because Sonya moved on from their relationship so quickly that she was already living with her new man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-are-steph-curry-39-s-parents-39-new-partners-so-controversial>Why Are Steph Curry's Parents' New Partners So Controversial?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-21-at-1-52-20-pm.png><p>After Steph Curry's parents went their separate ways, his mom Sonya Curry notably became involved with the man she was accused of moving on with, the former NFL player Steven Johnson. Considering her ex-husband's infidelity claims, that relationship seemed awkward enough.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Drake Fans Beg The Rapper To Ask Steph Curry's Mom Out On A Date</a></span></p><p>As it turned out, it was when the world learned that Dell Curry had a new significant other that things got really weird. The reason for that is when Sonya and Steven attended the 2022 NBA Finals, Dell and his new girlfriend Nikki Smith were also in the stands. Of course, while Steven attained a certain level of fame during his football career, most people have no idea who Nikki is. However, according to reports, Steven and Nikki certainly know each other extremely well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the reports are accurate, and they certainly seem to be, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steven and Nikki used to be married to each other</a>. Once that news began spreading online, fans started to refer to the whole situation as a wife swap.</p><p>Unfortunately for Steph, fans weren't the only ones who noticed that his dad and mom seemed to be dating two people who used to be married to one another. Instead, some of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steph's peers took note of what was going on and mocked the situation</a>.</p><p>A perfect example of the mockery that was thrown at the Curry family came from Gilbert Arenas, Tracy McGrady, and Matt Barnes. Fully aware they were being filmed, they talked about the Curry parents' "wife swap" and referred to the couple making "trades".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that even Steph's peers were mocking what was going on with his parents, it makes sense that during a 2022 interview with The Ringer, he called his parents' divorce "challenging". Still, as Steph explained, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he has chosen to not be mad about the situation</a>.</p><p>“It’s challenging for sure. I could be mad and be like, ‘Y’all effed this up.’ I could have that approach. But it’s going to be an acknowledgment of both of y’all in terms of how y’all raised me. The calmness I have in myself is because of y’all.”</p><p>As of 2023, it appears Dell and Sonya's divorce is ongoing, as there has been no confirmation on whether it's been finalized. However, given the attention surrounding their new relationships, it makes sense that they'd want to keep the most recent updates about their divorce private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZ2gnXqkwdGrsGacmau8s6%2FEZqeaqpWjwbR5w56jpWWjpLu6rYycrKuqqWKwsLnPpaCcmaSasW6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1291863-steve-austin-beer-truck-segment-wwe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Austin: The Beer Truck Was A Hell Of A Night At The Office, People Just Sh-t Their Pants">&larr;
