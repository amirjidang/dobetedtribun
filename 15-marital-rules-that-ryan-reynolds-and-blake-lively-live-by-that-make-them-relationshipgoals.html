They're both gorgeous people, inside and out, so it's really no surprise they're even better together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They've been dishing out little nuggets of relationship gold for five years now, and believe me, I've been taking notes. They go beyond the typical generic advice. What's even better is you can tell that they truly live by their own advice.</p><p>They're not afraid to poke fun at each other, be honest and upfront, and most importantly,&nbsp;trust and support each other. They're active in each other's lives, and they make family their number-one priority without letting their personal lives slip.</p><p>A common piece of advice given from married&nbsp;couples is to be friends first. Absolutely, that's important! Sounds simple enough, right? But there is so much more to it than that. Well, not to worry. Blake and Ryan have you covered! They know what it means to truly keep your friendship and marriage alive.</p><p>They give solid advice, and they stick by it. If they don't make you a little sick with envy, I don't know what will! Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are #relationshipgoals for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=understand-teamwork-and-make-it-a-priority><strong>Understand Teamwork And Make It A Priority</strong></h2><p>If anyone understands how to be a team, it's Ryan and Blake. In an interview with People, Blake told the interviewer that she and Ryan never work at the same time. They take their kids! They don't spend more than one night apart, and even that is rare.&nbsp;Many middle-class families don't necessarily have that option. You do what you have to do to support your family financially. But nonetheless, there's still plenty to take away from this. The less time spent apart, the better! Working together to make sure the family is a functioning as a unit is important.&nbsp;Lively also said in an interview with Vogue in 2014,</p><p><strong>"I get to share my life with the person he's become, and we get to grow from there."</strong></p><p>People grow and evolve over time, and you have to be willing to accept that and grow together. It's all about teamwork, baby!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-have-to-be-willing-to-make-sacrifices><strong>You Have To Be Willing To Make Sacrifices</strong></h2><p>They're&nbsp;not saying to give up everything you enjoy for your family. In fact, if you aren't personally fulfilled, you&nbsp;can't give your best to those around you.&nbsp;But Ryan certainly knows about sacrificing for his family. In an interview with AOL Build, he said,</p><p><strong>"When I wrapped up&nbsp;<i>Deadpool</i> five weeks ago, within an hour — I’m not joking, I still had chunks of glue from the scar makeup on my face — I was boarding a plane to Bangkok so I could get to my wife and baby right away. I’ll do anything to be with them."</strong></p><p>There's nothing sweeter than rushing home to your family after a long day of work. He works hard for his wife and kids, and that makes for a great marriage.</p><h2 id=show-interest-in-each-other-s-hobbies><strong>Show Interest In Each Other's Hobbies</strong></h2><p>This is something that some marriages seem to miss the mark on. It's okay to have your own separate hobbies and interests, but the more you do together, the better. It certainly seems to work for Blake and Ryan.&nbsp;Blake Lively told E! News that</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"[they're] involved in everything that the other does." She even went on to say, "But he’s influenced my taste so much on things like home design, things that I never loved before I now love because of him."</strong></p><p>Stick together, show interest in your partner's hobbies, and you'd be surprised just how close you can get. Showing interest in your husband or wife's hobbies is a great way to keep you busy&nbsp;and build your relationship further.&nbsp;Are you taking notes? Sounds like a recipe for happiness to us!</p><h2 id=approach-arguments-as-best-friends><strong>Approach Arguments As Best Friends</strong></h2><p>Blake Lively has some solid advice on how to approach arguments in your marriage. She told an interview with Glamour that in previous relationships, she would call her sisters or friends, explain her argument with her boyfriend, and ask them what she should do. Anyone in a successful marriage knows how detrimental this can be. Blake quickly learned this too. She's turned things around when it comes to Ryan.&nbsp;Ryan and Blake were friends for two years before they started dating. She says she treats him like one of her girlfriends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I’m like, ‘Hey, this happened. It upset me. This is how I feel. What do I do?’ And he does the same for me. He treats me like his best buddy."</strong></p><p>Sounds like a great relationship!</p><h2 id=always-put-family-first><strong>Always Put Family First</strong></h2><p>Through all the craziness in their lives, they always put their family first. That right there might be the key to a long and healthy marriage. No matter what they're going through or how busy they are, they keep their priorities straight.</p><p>They've always wanted a big family, and now that their two little ones are here, they're bringing their A-game. They take their kids to work and spend quality time together as often as possible. The few times they are apart, they rush back to be together. If you're wondering how they make it work, it comes easily to them. It's not all rainbows and sunshine, but they have such a deep love for each other, that nothing feels like a chore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sense-of-humor-is-everything><strong>Sense Of Humor Is Everything</strong></h2><p>Blake and Ryan swear by having a sense of humor. If you can't laugh at yourself sometimes, you're missing out on life. Ryan told Conan O'Brien that while Lively was giving birth, the doctor's cell phone went off and Blake said,</p><p><strong>"Oh no, go ahead, take a personal call. Feel free!" She was cracking jokes in the middle of her delivery.</strong></p><p>They rip on each other in interviews and on social media all the time too, all from a place of love of course. They know how to keep things real, and they're not overly sensitive. The two certainly know how to have a good time. If you're looking for a good laugh, just check out their Twitter and Instagram accounts, and you'll surely find them cracking jokes and poking fun at each other.</p><h2 id=challenge-each-other><strong>Challenge Each Other</strong></h2><p>While we already know they have grown together, and will continue to do so, they're serious about challenging each other and pushing each other to be the best they can. Plus, who doesn't love a little friendly competition?&nbsp;During an interview with E! News, Blake Lively said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I love that he challenges me. He’s someone that I trust when he challenges me. That's nice. It's nice to have a partner in everything."</strong></p><p>You said it, Blake! Anyone that truly wants to see you succeed and grow, and wants to help you get there, is a keeper. No doubt about it. Some couples subconsciously keep each other down, but not these two. They know that growth and change is inevitable, and the only way to make it through is to stick together and figure it out together.</p><h2 id=make-your-spouse-s-career-and-goals-a-priority><strong>Make Your Spouse's Career And Goals A Priority</strong></h2><p>Continuing on from their last piece of advice, making your spouse's career and goals a priority is important. Just imagine how hard it is for celebrities. Both of them are constantly under scrutiny, and they have to travel all the time. To make it through, you have to be supportive and keep your spouse's career goals in mind every step of the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This applies to anyone, whether you're famous or not. If one person is feeling fulfilled and is chasing their dreams while the other one feels stifled, it can cause some serious issues. And as usual, Ryan and Blake have that figured out. They support each other and take turns being with the kids equally, so they can both chase their passions.</p><h2 id=be-supportive><strong>Be Supportive</strong></h2><p>Ahh yes, of course! Who knew, right? No, it goes beyond just simply "being supportive". These two are great at talking each other up and showing as much support as possible. That's not to say that they've never uttered a rude work to each other before, but as a general rule, they're extremely sweet to each other.&nbsp;They know that boosting each other up and being their biggest fans is the way to go. Ryan said in an interview with AOL Build,</p><p><strong>"My wife knows how to rock a red carpet. I’ll say that. She might be the Beyoncé of red carpets. She’s turned that into an athletic event.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I see what goes into that, real science. It’s unbelievable.”</p><h2 id=revisit-old-moments-together><strong>Revisit Old Moments Together</strong></h2><p>Who doesn't love a little nostalgia? Blake and Ryan love to revisit places they've been before. One year Lively threw an amazing birthday party for Ryan at the restaurant where they fell in love. She even posted a picture on Instagram with the caption,</p><p><strong>"We fell in love at your restaurant in Boston. We stay in love at your restaurant in New York. Thank you for the best&nbsp;food and memories! You are our favourite!!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another happy birthday with @vancityreynolds. Hey, Reynolds, I like you a whole lot."&nbsp;How sweet is that? They certainly know how to keep the romance alive. Visiting old places is always a great way to bring the spark back. Not that their spark ever goes away.</p><h2 id=split-the-baby-duty><strong>Split The Baby Duty</strong></h2><p>Ryan had the ladies of the world ooo-ing and ahh-ing over his sweet words on life as a new father during an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers. He said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Just do the dirty work, man. You got to do the diapers, you got to do the middle -of-the night thing.</strong></p><p>I mean, your wife — a human being will exit your wife, so she’s done enough. Just change the diapers and do all that stuff."&nbsp;He's not wrong! Many women are left to completely handle all of the baby care, even immediately after, while they're still healing from giving birth. Helping with the baby is a surefire way to your lady's heart. Some men need to hear this quote.</p><h2 id=let-the-kids-bring-you-closer><strong>Let The Kids Bring You Closer</strong></h2><p>Instead of thinking of your kids as something that gets in between your relationship with your spouse, or even your personal growth, let them bring you closer. While on the Late Night Show With David Lettermen, he said,</p><p><strong>"I’m not one for vomiting declarations of sentiment out across the airwaves, but when we had that baby, I fell more in love with my wife than I’d ever been in my entire life, I couldn’t even believe it."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I couldn't have said it more beautifully. He really hit the nail on the head. It's a beautiful time in a married couple's lives. Having a baby should bring you together and give you a deeper love and appreciation for your spouse.</p><h2 id=understand-each-other-s-strengths><strong>Understand Each Other's Strengths</strong></h2><p>We already know that Ryan Reynolds is the King at telling the world what a beautiful, inspiring woman his wife is. He's her biggest fan, there's no doubt about it. But it goes deeper than that. He knows how to truly appreciate her strengths.&nbsp;Once again, Ryan had the best things to say about Blake in a Humans of New York Instagram post.</p><p><strong>"She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. She’ll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she’s made me a more empathetic person.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didn’t want to remember. She made me remember the good times."&nbsp;Their strengths perfectly balance out each other's weaknesses, and they lift each other up to heights that they wouldn't be able to achieve alone. It's simply beautiful.</p><h2 id=be-best-friends-first><strong>Be Best Friends First</strong></h2><p>You hear it all the time, but that's only because it's true. Being friends before lovers is absolutely important. It's not about what happens under the sheets, or when you're feeling romantic. It's about your day-to-day life. It's about loving your time together because you're best friends. As you know, they were friends for two years before dating, and it played a big role in their perfect marriage. They had the chance to really get to know each other before committing to a life-long partnership.&nbsp;Ryan said at an Entertainment Weekly interview, "About a year after <i>Green Lantern&nbsp;</i>had come and gone and we were both single we went on a double date — [Blake] was on a date with another guy and I was on a date with another girl — and it was like the most awkward date for the respective parties because we were just like fireworks coming across.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>We were buddies for a long time, which I think is the best way to have a relationship, to start as friends."</strong></p><p>Beautiful words. The way they look at each other and continue to stay committed and totally in love is enough to make me want to write their quotes down and live by them. Good for Blake and Ryan! They rock!</p><h2 id=they-make-date-night-a-priority><strong>They Make Date Night A Priority</strong></h2><p>Blake and Ryan have quite a few friends in Hollywood and we often see them on double dates with other lovely celeb couples. A few weeks ago, they were on a double date with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Krasinski</a>&nbsp;and Emily Blunt at the Guggenheim for Stanley Tucci's new film,&nbsp;Final Portrait.&nbsp;They were there supporting him because he's married to Emily's sister, Felicity Blunt.</p><p>They clearly know how to pick their friends because John and Emily also prioritize their children and each other. These two couples are definitely #relationshipgoals. Emily and Blake have been spotted hanging out during Fashion Week, laughing and sharing stories like they've been besties forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vogue.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eonline.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aol.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">glamour.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">instyle.com</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWK6or7IrZilZaKquaa%2FjK2fmqxdp8aiuoyrnLKmn6GxtHnAp5tmmpyWuKZ5y6KtnqSpYrmqwsRmmbJlpJ2utXnMmqKeZaSdsq550Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipnqiZnKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-shocking-details-surrounding-rob-kardashian-and-blac-chynas-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Shocking Details Surrounding Rob Kardashian And Blac Chyna's Relationship">&larr;
