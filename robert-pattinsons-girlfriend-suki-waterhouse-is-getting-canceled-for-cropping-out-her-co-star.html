One wrote on Reddit: "tldr twigs got a lot of racist hate from his stans when they were together, and he never really stood up for her."</p><p>Others noted that the other cast members, Keough, Be, and even <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong>'s ex-girlfriend, Camila Morrone "all posted a photo with all four women," so "it's pretty undeniable that Suki is purposely leaving Nabiyah out."</p><p>There are also screenshots of Waterhouse liking offensive content on social media. Before we dive into what fans are saying about the model-turned-actress, here's a closer look at her relationship with Pattinson, as well as her role in the miniseries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Robert Pattinson Isn't The Only Celebrity With A Bizarre Phobia That Makes It Nearly Impossible To Film Certain Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=how-long-have-robert-pattinson-amp-suki-waterhouse-been-dating>How Long Have Robert Pattinson & Suki Waterhouse Been Dating?</h2><p>Pattinson and Waterhouse were first linked in 2018. In January 2020, the two were rumored to be engaged when the latter was spotted wearing a gold ring on <strong>that</strong> finger. Months later, they were quarantined together. The former's GQ Magazine cover stated that he was "in London with his girlfriend, in the apartment the Batman folks rented for him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Robert-Pattinson-And-Girlfriend-Suki-Waterhouse.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2020, a source finally set the record straight on the engagement rumors. "Rob and Suki have definitely discussed getting engaged but are in no rush," they told E! News. "Suki is not pressuring him and they are both very committed to each other." They noted that the two "are a really good match" and had "both been spending time in the UK together during this last year and their relationship is stronger than ever."</p><p>They attended the Met Gala together in May 2023 — a rare red carpet appearance as a couple. Three months before that, Waterhouse told The Times: "I'm shocked that I'm so happy with someone for nearly five years. "I'm always incredibly excited when I see his name pop up [on my phone] or even a text, and I think he feels the same about me. We've always got so much to say, and I find him hilarious."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Robert Pattinson Had A Hard Time Memorizing His Lines After Twilight</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-did-suki-waterhouse-play-in-daisy-jones-and-the-six>Who Did Suki Waterhouse Play In Daisy Jones And The Six?</h2><p>Waterhouse played pianist, Karen Sirko in Daisy Jones and the Six. "I really wanted that project, and maybe subconsciously it was something to do with my own desire to make a record," she told Insider in February 2023, adding how she'd "always desperately wanted to have the life of a musician and I was really drawn to the project because of that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/suki-waterhouse-instagram.jpg><p>She continued: "Then my life was kind of melded into these two things, where I recorded my record while prepping for Daisy Jones. That was a huge gift that that studio was open to us for two years and we would go like, three hours a day and work to become a band. That was basically the goal to be like, 'We could go on tour.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Love, Rosie alum released her own album in May 2022 while preparing for the show. "As my record was coming out, because we were delayed and pushed back, it weirdly coincided with actually releasing the record while I'm on set," she recalled, "which was like, kind of completely insane. Didn't think that was gonna happen."</p><p>Grateful for the coincidence, Waterhouse said: "From getting the job to where I am now, I kind of don't even know if those two things would've existed without each other. It's a beautiful gift that I got from playing that character."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Robert Pattinson Lied When The Kirsten Stewart Rumors First Started</a></span></p><h2 id=what-are-fans-saying-about-suki-waterhouse-getting-canceled>What Are Fans Saying About Suki Waterhouse Getting Canceled?</h2><p>Speaking about the cropping scandal, a Reddit commenter explained that it comes off wrong as "overall, as a black women while being cropped out of a photo might not seem like a big deal, it is for us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They went on to say that "Black people, but especially black women in Hollywood have spoken countlessly about their mistreatment from their white co-star and peers and each time they do they get labeled 'difficult to work with.' So I'm just frustrated by this exclusion."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/suki.jpg><p>Another one weighed in, claiming that "they definitely cropped her out because racism but she also outshines every other woman in this photo (and in that stupid show) so it’s definitely racism and envy." The heavy accusations were also backed by a previous report by Variety "about how Daisy Jones and the Six are changing the narrative for women in Hollywood," said another commenter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It apparently "received backlash for leaving out Nabiyah Be," which the Redditor said "rightfully deserved getting slammed."
