Shockingly, he attended that high school with a kid who went on to become a successful actor, too.</p><p>Let's take a look back at Renner's life and see which star he attended high school with.</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner-is-an-mcu-star>Jeremy Renner Is An MCU Star</h2><p>Back in 1995, Jeremy Renner began landing professional acting work, and he spent years making his way in Hollywood before getting roles that helped thrust him into the spotlight. Once he broke out and became a star, Renner never looked back.</p><p>The actor truly hit the big time when he landed the role of Hawkeye in the MCU. Yes, he had success prior to that, but becoming an original Avenger in the biggest franchise in the world changed everything in an instant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Hawkeye, Renner would pull down massive paychecks and have a hand in shaping the MCU. He has been featured in the franchise's biggest movies, and just last year, he starred on his own MCU series.</p><p>When discussing how his character had changed through the years, Renner said, "I think the biggest change ultimately has been the losses. It's been managing the losses of everyone he's known closely, from Natasha (Romanoff aka Black Widow) to the Avengers. It's a giant weight he carries on his back, of five years of Ronin. Wonderfully, we get to explore those changes, those feelings on this show. We have six hours to explore it, and there are new characters who help with that."</p><p>Unlike a number of his peers who are either from L.A. or come from show business families and benefited from nepotism, Jeremy Renner hails from a Central Valley town that most people have never even heard of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Jeremy Renner And Brie Larson's Rumored Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-from-modesto-california-and-so-is-someone-else>He's From Modesto, California And So Is Someone Else</h2><p>During his younger years, Jeremy Renner spent his days growing up in Modesto, California. Never heard of it? Well, you're not alone.</p><p>The town itself is primarily noteworthy for being the setting of American Graffiti, George Lucas' first major hit. In fact, Modesto was the place where Lucas grew up, too.</p><p>When talking about his life <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">growing up in Modesto</a>, Renner said, "It was a great place to grow up because the community. I was a latchkey kid so I could do whatever the heck I wanted growing up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’d make it home before my sister did … so I wouldn’t have to compete with her [for snacks]. But I always did my homework," he added.</p><p>Not only did Renner grow up in Modesto, but he also attended college there, as well. That little school is called Modesto Junior College, and it's where Renner took a drama class and figured out that he wanted to pursue acting.</p><p>Renner has since gone on to achieve a lot in a difficult industry, proving that stars can come from anywhere. Despite Modesto being a small place, Renner actually attended high school with a future television star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Jeremy Renner Really Ask To Be Booted From The 'MCU'?</a></span></p><h2 id=renner-went-to-high-school-with-timothy-olyphant>Renner Went To High School With Timothy Olyphant</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, which major TV star did Jeremy Renner go to high school with in the little-known California town? Turns out, it was none other than Timothy Olyphant, who has also been a massive success in Hollywood.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Historic Modesto</a>, "Olyphant was a classmate of Jeremy Renner in high school, though they were in different graduating classes. Renner and Olyphant have similar acting styles and a very intelligent approach to choosing their material. They both excel at their craft, and both often reflect on their youth in Modesto, a place where they both first found their spirit and drive."</p><p>It's pretty random that even a single person from Modesto became a major actor, but to have two from the same high school is practically unheard of.</p><p>Just a few towns over in Manteca, California, Justin Roiland of Rick and Morty fame grew up. In fact, he also attended Modesto Junior College, just like Jeremy Renner. These little towns are hardly a blip on the radar, and yet, they've produced some major names in entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jeremy Renner Will Continue To Play Hawkeye In The MCU Despite Accusations</a></span></p><p>Jeremy Renner and Timothy Olyphant are both thriving in Hollywood, and it's wild to think that this pair once attended high school together in a town that people only knew from a George Lucas movie.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Scarlett Johansson Actually Like Jeremy Renner?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqVosZuvsSnpZ6qXZa7pXnToqSorJiuerC42KmfmqakYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-silvija-duran-make-latest-silvija-duran-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Silvija Duran Make?
