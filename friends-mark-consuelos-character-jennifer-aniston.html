Just about any celebrity who was big in the '90s and '00s had some sort of guest role, and they didn't always need a connection to one of the leads (like Brad Pitt had) to make it on screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, some actors were just starting out when they were offered roles on 'Friends.' Not every guest-starring opportunity turned into a significant career move, but it probably helped plenty of up-and-coming stars' resumes look a little meatier.</p><p>And the tradeoff was that 'Friends' had an ever-circulating pool of talent to choose from, making each episode something special.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt Messed Up His First Words On Friends</a></span></p><p>There were some almost-misses with casting, of course. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox&nbsp;almost had an entirely different role</a> instead of portraying Monica. But when it came time to cast a policeman on the episode 'The One with Chandler's Dad' in 2001, there was only one man for the job. Well, basically there were two, but Mark Consuelos was number one.</p><p>In that episode of 'Friends,' Mark Consuelos portrayed "Policeman #1," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, and had the tall order of pulling over Rachel and Ross. Rachel then flirted with him to get out of a ticket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, though the officer's name wasn't listed on IMDb, Rachel calls him "Officer Handsome," to which he responds, "it's Hanson..."</p><p>What's interesting about the role is that it was&nbsp;early on in Mark's career. By that point, he had been portraying Mateo Santos on 'All My Children' for a few years already, but he wasn't quite a household name just yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mark-consuelos-friends-police-officer.jpg><p>From 1995 to 2010, Mark acted on over 100 episodes of 'All My Children,' and then he appeared on a few other shows before landing the 'Friends' gig. He had a bigger break in 2004 when he began starring on 'Missing,' and from there, Mark never really left TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Except now, Consuelos is on&nbsp;streaming TV with 'Riverdale.' He's come a long way since that minor role on 'Friends,' but fans definitely haven't forgotten about it.</p><p>Of course, some publications erroneously report that 'Friends' was Mark's second-ever acting gig, and that's clearly not the case. Although he was a male entertainer prior to being cast in 'All My Children,' he wasn't hard up for a job by the time 'Friends' came around.</p><p>But who would turn down the opportunity to appear on the sitcom, after so many stars had already done it and received notoriety? When Mark's turn came up, a long list of guests had already passed through. Who knew where the opportunity could lead?</p><p>As it turns out, Consuelos has had a showstopper of a career, even if his wife is arguably more famous than he is. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two are still as adorably in love as ever</a>, of course, and there's also the perk of a built-in guest-hosting gig while Kelly's at the helm of her show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of 'Riverdale' Ranked From Youngest To Oldest</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecyaqaRlk6S7tMHEpaasZZOdrrOtwq2cq2WamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./olivia-rodrigo-boyfriend-adam-faze-who-is-he-scandal-age-difference.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Olivia Rodrigos Boyfriend, Adam Faze">&larr;
