Marie suspected that her daughter was meeting someone and not going to the store since she had taken extra time to dress up and shower.&nbsp;</p><p>When Kassanndra did not return home or respond to calls and texts, her mother became worried and believed that she was staying with her best friend Alexandra McNary.</p><p>However, Alexandra was also concerned as Kassanndra did not show up for her first sonography appointment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The investigation revealed the mysterious truths</h2><p>Following Marie’s report of Kassanndra’s disappearance, the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department conducted an investigation into the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of this investigation, detectives spoke with Kassanndra’s friend Alexandra, who provided them with crucial information.</p><p>Alexandra informed the detectives that Colin was likely the father of Kassanndra’s unborn child, which was due in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>She also revealed that Colin had a history of not wanting children, and he had previously told Kassanndra that he would sue for full custody if any of his girlfriends got pregnant and refused to have an <a href=#>abortion</a>.</p><p>Despite Colin’s stance on having children, Kassanndra informed him about her pregnancy on August 12, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>During their conversation, Kassanndra offered Colin the option to relinquish his parental rights and not be responsible for child support.</p><p>Colin’s response was surprisingly calm, and he promised Kassanndra that they would discuss the matter further.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-investigation-1-1024x536.jpg><p>However, the investigators soon discovered evidence that pointed towards Colin as a suspect in Kassanndra’s disappearance. During the investigation, it was revealed that Colin and Kassanndra had a history together.</p><p>The detectives discovered that Colin was allegedly unhappy about Kassanndra’s pregnancy and did not want the baby. As a result, he became a suspect in the case, and he was eventually charged with first-degree murder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The authorities discovered her car</h2><p>Kassanndra’s white Mazda was discovered by investigators on August 28, parked on the 200 block of East 25th Street in Tacoma, near a highway overpass close to the Tacoma Dome.&nbsp;</p><p>She had been driving the car on the day she was reported missing, and the car keys were found inside the center console.</p><p>The detectives noted the presence of a light rail system on the street, and after reviewing the surveillance footage from the rail system, they identified a man wearing a mask and a black fedora walking away from Kassanndra’s car.</p><p>Through various surveillance footage, investigators found that the man was driving a pickup truck registered in Colin’s name.&nbsp;</p><p>Further investigation revealed that Kassanndra had last communicated with Colin before her disappearance, but Colin denied any recent contact with her and claimed to know nothing about her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who executed Kassanndra? Where is he now?</h2><p>Suspicious of his involvement, detectives searched Colin’s house and found his truck, the black hat, and other evidence pointing to his potential involvement in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their efforts, they did not have enough evidence to make an arrest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-footage-683x1024.jpg><p>Detectives used cadaver dogs to search Colin’s basement, particularly a brown couch that interested the dogs. However, they still did not have enough evidence to arrest Colin.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the detectives stated, <strong>“He’s guilty of something. But… what is he guilty of?”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The police then seized the black box from Colin’s truck, which proved to be the key piece of evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Using GPS data, investigators determined that Colin’s truck had stopped near a wooded area along Chambers Creek Road W. in University Place, about eight miles from his home.&nbsp;</p><p>After scouring the area, the police found Kassanndra’s remains and arrested Colin.</p><p>Colin pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 26 years and eight months in prison in November 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the 40-year-old is incarcerated at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzqWgp2WUqrGtsdhmqq2noq58</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./courteney-cox-kept-secret-friends-interview-oprah.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courteney Cox Kept This Secret During A Friends Interview">&larr;
