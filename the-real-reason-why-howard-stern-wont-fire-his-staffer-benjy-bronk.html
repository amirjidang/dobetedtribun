At least, that's what many fans of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a></strong>'s iconic radio show think. To be fair, every single one of Howard's die-hard followers has an opinion about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his popular staff members</a>, many of whom are portrayed heavily on his show. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard's longtime co-host, best-friend, and newswoman, Robin Quivers</a>, gets her fair share of criticism. But nobody, not even<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> producer Gary "Ba Ba Booey" Dell'Abate</a> gets as much authentically negative flack as Benjy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is because Benjy argues everything and anything in an annoyingly polite manner. Then there's the thing about the secrecy behind his actual age, his aggressive outbursts, and the shtick... the constant shtick. Everything becomes something with this guy... and it's exhausting.</p><p>But, at a certain point, the pessimism that Stern Show writer Benjy Bronk receives becomes hilarious bits on the show. Even if fans love to hate him, entering the "Benjy Vortex" has it's moments. It's pure contrarian shtick, but it can be fun...</p><p>However, Benjy has rubbed Howard the wrong way on many occasions, especially when he's late for work... All of this has got<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fans wondering why Howard hasn't fired the guy</a>...</p><p>Here's why...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-plays-a-bully-on-air-but-he-has-a-hard-time-being-one-in-reality>Howard Plays A Bully On Air, But He Has A Hard Time Being One In Reality</h2><p>The biggest thing holding Howard back from firing Benjy for all the times he's been late or abused his show privileges in other ways is the fact that Howard just can't fire anyone. On his show, Howard is known for bringing down the hammer in some truly brutal ways. But all of this is part of his comedy. In reality, he's a softy who avoids conflict at all costs. He also knows how awful being fired truly is as he was fired from one of his radio job at WNBC.</p><p>In a recent episode of The Howard Stern Show, Howard recounted how challenging it was to look his then-baby daughter in the eye after he was fired.</p><p>This feeling is the main reason he's stopped himself from firing Benjy or basically anyone else.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern Defended BTS From Racist Attacks From His Own Staffer</a></span></p><p>While there are other people at the show who can do this for him, Howard feels the responsibility falls on his shoulders. Specifically when it comes to Benjy since he was an on-air talent for many years and would be writing jokes for Howard from only a few feet away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Benjy has been late for his relatively easy job many, many times. When he did work in-studio with Howard, this would always anger him. Benjy would burst into the studio while Howard was either preparing for work or even already on-air.</p><p>On top of this, Benjy would cause havoc with the SiriusXM security as he would blow past the check-in point in order to get into work. And when he did arrive, he would be drenched in sweat from running up the stairs... When he wasn't detained by security, that is.</p><p>All of this was maddening to Howard.</p><p>"What the f*** am I supposed to do. I need you here on time," Howard said right before he finally did up punish Benjy in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-has-been-able-to-punish-benjy>Howard Has Been Able To Punish Benjy</h2><p>While Howard has found it almost impossible to fire Benjy, he has greatly diminished his role at the show. This started a decade ago when Howard punished Benjy for his behavior by banning him from appearing on The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show, which is hosted by Jon Hein and Gary Dell'Abate immediately after Howard's radio program.</p><p>This really hurt Benjy as he loved to be featured on the show where he had pretty much free-reign without Howard cutting him off. He could plug whatever he wanted, say whatever he wanted, and not have to deal with too many people coming at him with criticism.</p><p>But ever since Howard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banned him from The Wrap Up Show in 2010</a>, Benjy has only been able to appear on that show two or three times. Additionally, he is almost never allowed to plug any other work he's doing. The exception to that rule was when he was promoting his cameos in the Sharknado movies or on a soap opera... But Benjy is always the butt of the joke when that happens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this punishment wasn't nearly as severe as when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard kicked Benjy out of his studio</a>. For years, Benjy would be working silently in the back of the on-air studio alongside Howard, Robin Quivers, Fred Norris, and Artie Lange (before he left). But in 2016, he continued tardiness angered Howard so much that he permanently kicked him out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Howard Stern Kept Robin Quivers Alive, According To Her</a></span></p><p>Now, Benjy writes jokes for Howard from another room. While he's gotten used to it, Benjy clearly hates it even though he, on occasion, gets invited in for a bit or two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But even when Benjy does come in for a sketch or to comment on something, he always makes things difficult... REALLY DIFFICULT. There's always some schtick or comment he makes the audience and his colleagues frustrated... And boy do the other staffers gets angry with him... Whether it's over philosophical or political things such as the fact he's a Trump supporter, or that he just can't order a meal without making a fuss... Honestly, there are endless things to be irritated about when it comes to Benjy Bronk.</p><p>However, Benjy Bronk is likely to stay at The Howard Stern Show for the long run since the famous host is unable to bring the ax down on him.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern Thinks George Stephanopoulos Should Replace Alex Trebek On ‘Jeopardy’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZp%2Bor5GnsW6%2F056pp2WnpLu1ecWiqZ5lmJ7Abr%2FTmp2fnaJir6a6ybJkm6qfo7hw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-ridiculous-reason-why-mark-wahlberg-missed-out-on-donnie-darko.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Ridiculous Reason Why Mark Wahlberg Missed Out On A Beloved Role">&larr;
