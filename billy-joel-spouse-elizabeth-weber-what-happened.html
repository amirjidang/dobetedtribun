Besides being rich and famous beyond most people's dreams, he also has lived throught some interesting family drama. In the 73 years that he's been alive, Billy's had 4 wives, as well as 3 children. He's also dealt with<a href=#> a notable scamming issue</a> and also lost money due to his <a href=#>numerous costly divorces</a>. Billy's far from the only legendary musician who's had issues like this, though. <a href=#>Elton John's had his fair share of financial problems</a> as well. Tabloids are often filled with drama involved in big-time celebrities' lives.</p><p>The "Who Didn't Start The Fire" <a href=#>singer has plenty of songs about love</a>, so naturally, many people have been interested in his love life. Arguably, his most famous wife was Elizabeth Ann Weber. His first wife, Elizabeth, has completely disappeared from the public eye since their divorce back in 1982. Before that, she was involved in a lot of drama surrounding Billy's life. Numerous books and articles have been written about her, since she's caused Billy a lot of trouble and grief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Billy-Joel.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Is The Point Of Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start The Fire' And Why Does He Hate It?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>This is why Billy Joel really hates one of his biggest hits and what the song really means.</span><p>All of this, and yet Elizabeth has always been a major mystery. She was quite the enigma even when she was in the public eye. <strong>So what has she been up to since then?</strong></p><h2 id=who-was-billy-joel-39-s-wife-elizabeth-weber>Who Was Billy Joel's Wife, Elizabeth Weber?</h2><p>Elizabeth has been a disappearing act her whole life. The first major occurrence was when she disappeared from Billy and their mutual friends when Billy first met her back in the 70s.</p><p>That was the decade when Billy first became famous. His breakout song happened to be his most famous, his hit "Piano Man". It was a semi-biographical song about himself. After that song, many full-length biographies would be written about Billy. Large parts would be about Billy and Elizabeth's relationship, and boy was it riveting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/billyjoel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elizabeth had a crazy effect on Billy. In an article Billy wrote for Rolling Stone, Billy admitted to attempting to take his own life. He attributed most of that to his depression, but his situation at the time was not very great. This was around the time he was 21. He was borderline homeless, a struggling musician, and, worst of all - he was in love with his drummer's wife. This happened to be Elizabeth.</p><p>After the culmination of the love triangle, Elizabeth disappeared from everybody involved. This was when <strong>Billy actually attempted to take his own life</strong>, but thankfully, he survived the attempt. Elizabeth would come back to Billy, and they'd get married in 1973.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/This-SNL-Star-Described-Chevy-Chase-And-Bill-Murrays-Fight-As-Sad_-Painful-And-Awful.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Billy Joel Told Howard Stern His Version Of Chevy Chase's Fist Fight With Bill Murray Backstage On Saturday Night Live</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Billy Joel told Howard Stern he thought the "Saturday Night Live" cast was "crazy" after witnessing the backstage altercation.</span><p>After that, Billy would become the successful musician everyone knows today. He continued to be obsessed with his wife Elizabeth, and their love continued to hurt him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was he obsessed with Elizabeth romantically, but he also allowed her to be his manager. It was actually Elizabeth's biological brother who was the one that got involved in that crazy lawsuit with Billy. Elizabeth being involved with Billy's financials was the root cause of all of that.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-elizabeth-weber>What Happened To Elizabeth Weber?</h2><p>Billy and Elizabeth would eventually divorce in 1982. Since then, she's pretty much disappeared off the face of the planet. What has she been up to?</p><p>According to Tuko, Elizabeth hasn't been publicly seen since 1982. As mentioned previously, she's always lived a very private life. Even the people closest to her have lacked information about her, such as when she went missing from Billy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The whole situation is pretty jarring. Not many people can completely disappear from fame. Elizabeth herself wasn't that famous, but she was married to one of the most famous men of that era. Surely she couldn't have completely hidden away. However, there aren't any public records, let alone public photos or anything of the like.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-billy-joel-39-s-other-wives>What Happened To Billy Joel's Other Wives?</h2><p>Since Billy divorced Elizabeth in 1982, he's married <strong>three other women</strong>.</p><p>There are not many people that have had <strong>more than two wives</strong>. There definitely aren't many people that have had more than two like Billy, aside from celebrities like Elon Musk or William Shatner.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/billy-joel-madison-square-garden-70th-birthday-concert.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Billy Joel Revealed The Baffling Reason He Quit Songwriting In This Years-Ago Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Billy Joel quit writing songs after one perceived failure, but kept the reason hidden for decades.</span><p>Just three years after Billy and Elizabeth officially fell apart, Billy married another woman. This happened to be his second wife Christie Brinkley, the mother of <a href=#>Billy's first child Alexa Ray Joel</a>. Their marriage, like Billy's previous, would go to last about a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After their divorce in 1994, Billy would get married for a third time in 2004 with chef Katie Lee.
