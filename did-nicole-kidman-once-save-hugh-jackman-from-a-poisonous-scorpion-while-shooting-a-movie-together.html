Rumor has it, Kidman saved Jackman from the scorpion by capturing it in a hat. Many have accepted this story as fact, but it might not actually be true.</p><h2 id=rumor-has-it-nicole-saved-hugh-39-s-live-by-capturing-a-poisonous-scorpion-while-on-set>Rumor Has It Nicole Saved Hugh's Live By Capturing A Poisonous Scorpion While On Set</h2><p>While the actors were admittedly uncomfortable with filming romantic scenes, another rumored uncomfortable occurrence has become the stuff of legend.</p><p>Kidman was filming a scene where she had to join Jackman in a sleeping bag underneath the stars. It was during the filming of this scene, however, that Kidman reportedly noticed a poisonous scorpion crawling up Jackman's leg.</p><p>Kidman is said to have told Jackman not to move and scooped the scorpion into her hat. The actress is said to have released the animal back into the wild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar43090470.jpg><p>"Everyone applauded, but we did ask her why she hadn’t just stomped on it," <a href=# rel=nofollow>an onlooker recalled</a>.</p><p>Kidman allegedly responded, "I would never kill an animal. Every creature here has its purpose. This one just didn’t belong in Hugh’s bag!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hugh Jackman Is Already Bulking Up To Play Wolverine Again</a></span></p><p>The story sounds very sweet. However, it might not actually be true. <a href=# rel=nofollow>When speaking to Extra about the situation</a>, Kidman denied there were any scorpions in the area.</p><p>"I don't think we even have scorpions here," she laughed. "It's quite good to be able to do these interviews and say what's definitely untrue. You get to set the record straight. Yes, no scorpions."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hugh-jackman-said-his-kissing-scenes-with-nicole-were-awkward-because-of-his-wife-39-s-friendship-with-the-actress>Hugh Jackman Said His Kissing Scenes With Nicole Were Awkward Because Of His Wife's Friendship With The Actress</h2><p>The 2008 film Australia followed the story of Lady Sarah Ashley, a woman who travels to England to take over a newly-inherited ranch. She befriends Drover, a local man in Australia who helps her. The epic love story starred Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. The film did well and saw audiences praising the chemistry between the two leads.</p><p>However, the film would require some romantic scenes between Kidman and Jackman. This wasn't entirely comfortable for Jackman. His wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, is close friends with Kidman and Jackman said this made their kissing scenes very awkward.</p><p>"Nicole lived with my wife Deb when she first came to Hollywood, so they’re best of friends," <a href=# rel=nofollow>he said during his BAFTA interview</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar29697082.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Jackman revealed that his wife didn't come on set during the filming of the romantic scenes. It didn't seem to be an issue for Furness, who actually encouraged Jackman to accept the role. Kidman was also uncomfortable with having to kiss her best friend's husband.</p><p>She was even upset with her performance in the film. Noting that she usually doesn't watch her films, she was talked into attending the premiere by director Baz Luhrmann.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nicole Kidman's Strange Fear And 9 Other Facts About The Movie Star</a></span></p><p>"I don’t usually see my films, but because of Baz, I had to see it [Australia]. I saw Moulin Rouge. I’ve really only seen that and this in my whole career," Kidman shared.</p><p>When she attended the Sydney premiere, Kidman said that she was so upset with her performance, she turned to husband Keith Urban for feedback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I sat there, and I looked at Keith and went, ‘Am I any good in this movie?’" she recalled.</p><h2 id=nicole-stuns-by-making-a-100-000-bid-on-a-hat-signed-by-hugh-jackman>Nicole Stuns By Making A $100,000 Bid On A Hat Signed By Hugh Jackman</h2><p>Kidman might not have saved him from a scorpion, but she definitely helped a cause that was close to Jackman's heart.</p><p>In 2022, Kidman made an appearance at a performance of Jackman's play The Music Man. Kidman ended up bidding $100,000 on a hat which Jackman signed. The proceeds went to the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS charity.</p><p>"I love you. I love Broadway. And I love what they do, Broadway Cares, but I also want to say this show is extraordinary," <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kidman said after stepping up to the stage</a>.</p><p>"I’ve known Nic for almost 30 years. I’ve worked with her. I can tell you this is not a surprise to me. She is one of the most generous souls I know," Jackman said. "You’re a beautiful person. I love you. Thank you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49132768-1.jpg><p>After the crowd delivered an enthused reaction to Kidman's bid, Jackman joked, "I just want to be clear, this is not Australian dollars." Kidman's bid would amount to $148,744 Australian dollars under current conversion rates.</p><p>"Ms. Kidman’s remarkable support of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS on Saturday night was wonderful to see and her extraordinary generosity will be deeply appreciated by the entire Broadway community," producer Kate Horton said in a statement.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hugh Jackman Almost Lost His Role In X-Men After Completely Embarrassing Himself During The Audition</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Viola, Broadway Cares executive director, said, "Broadway Cares is blessed with friends across Broadway. But we have no greater champion than Hugh Jackman. This extraordinary gift from his pal Nicole Kidman is by far the largest donation for any one auction item ever. That’s 20,000 meals and 2,000 doctor visits this holiday season for those living with HIV/AIDS, struggling with COVID-19 or facing other life-threatening challenges. Donations made at The Music Man, all across Broadway, Off-Broadway and at national touring productions will provide meals and medication, health care and hope this holiday season."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdo7aku8ueZKShlKKur3nOp5qeZaOWw6Z5x66eoWWalrCsucCnZJ%2Bqn6J6onnPqKCsp56kwrR50pymq6iZpLtuw8eio55lo528sMDIp55mmV2ivLe1xGarqJ%2BVqbWmvo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./orlanne-antignac-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-654783-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Orlanne Antignac Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
