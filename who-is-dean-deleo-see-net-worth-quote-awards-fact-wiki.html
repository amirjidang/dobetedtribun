DeLeo’s career started in the late 1970s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Dean DeLeo is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources DeLeo’s net worth is as high as $15 million, an amount earned through his successful career in music. Apart from Stone Temple Pilots, Dean has had success with bands Army of Anyone, Talk Show and Laughter Train, which also improved his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dean-deleo-net-worth-15-million></span>Dean DeLeo Net Worth $15 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although born in Montclair, New Jersey, he grew up in the Jersey Shore community of Point Pleasant Beach, with his younger brother Robert.</p><p>From an early age, Dean and Robert would practice guitar and bass respectively, which led to them playing in a number of cover bands. However, the two parted ways in the early ‘80s and Dean pursued a career in business. Robert formed his own band, called Mighty Joe Young, which was in need of a guitarist in the late ‘80s, and Dean agreed to join. The band, now consisting of Robert DeLeo on bass, Dean on guitar, Scott Weiland as a singer and Eric Kretz on drums, recorded a demo tape in 1990, and started playing in San Diego area clubs, building up a name for themselves. Their next step was the move to Los Angeles and expanding their influence, before long signing a contract with Atlantic Records, and releasing their debut full-length studio album “Core”. The album immediately became a hit, reaching No. 3 on the US Charts, and eventually achieving eight times platinum status, which only increased Dean’s net worth to a large degree.</p><p>Two years after the debut release, the band recorded their second album, “Purple”, which became even more successful. The album topped the US and Australian charts, and with singles “Big Empty”, “Vasoline” and “Interstate Love Song”, only cemented the band’s place among other successful rock acts of the ‘90s. Furthermore, the album achieved six times platinum status in the USA, increasing further Dean’s net worth. Their third album came out in 1996, “Tiny Music…Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop”; the band was still at the top of the music scene, as the album reached No. 4 on the US charts and achieved double platinum status, however, Scott Weiland became addicted to drugs, and as a result the band was disbanded in 1997.</p><p>Following Weiland’s departure and disbandment, the rest continued under the name Talk Show, with addition of Dave Coutts from the rock band Ten Inch Men as a singer. They released one album “Talk Show” (1997), before the band ceased to exist.</p><p>Scott returned to the rest of the band members, and they started recording the fourth Stone Temple Pilots’ album. The recording came out in 1999, under the title “No. 4”, and reached No. 6 on the US charts, while also achieving platinum status. They again dissolved in 2002 but before that released a fifth album, called “Shangri-La Dee Da” in 2001, which was the least popular so far, reaching No.9 on the charts, while selling just a little more than 50,000 copies.</p><p>Dean than started working with the singer Richard Patrick and his band Filter, and soon formed a new band called Army of Anyone, with Patrick behind the microphone, Robert DeLeo on bass, Dean as a guitarist and Ray Luzier on drums. They released one, self-titled album, which reached No. 56 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with numerous positive critiques, however Dean and Robert reformed the Stone Temple Pilots once again, and Army of Anyone was no more.</p><p>In 2010, Stone Temple Pilots released their last, self-titled album, with the original singer Scott Weiland, since he was fired by the band in 2013 and two years later died of a drug overdose.<br>The DeLeo brothers found a replacement in Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, who filled-in until 2015, when he decided to leave and focus entirely on Linkin Park.</p><p>Since then, Dean and the rest of the band are apparently still in search of a new vocalist.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Dean has been married to Jenn since 2012.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dean DeLeo</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 23, 1961</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Montclair, New Jersey USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jenn DeLeo</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Robert DeLeo</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>DeLeo, Dean</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1510395/</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Atlantic Records, Machine Shop Records</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Core, Unplugged, Purple, Tiny Music… Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop, No. 4, Shangri-La Dee Da, Stone Temple Pilots, High Rise, Mighty Joe Young Demo</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Stone Temple Pilots (Since&nbsp;1986), Army of Anyone, Talk Show</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Gibson Les Paul</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Guitarist of the alternative rock band Stone Temple Pilots.
