She also was a successful solo artist, having her own No. 1 hit, “José Cuervo” in 1983.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-age></span><span>Shelly West Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>West was born on May 23, 1958, He is currently 61 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-height></span><span>Shelly West Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her height is currently unknown. This information will be updated soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-early-life></span><span>Shelly West Early Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shelly West was born on May 23, 1958, in Cleveland, Ohio. Her mother, Dottie, was in the early phase of her singing career at the time, performing in local clubs and on television. Her father, Bill West, was a steel guitarist and songwriter. Dottie and Bill would have four children together. Shelly and her family moved to Nashville in 1961.</p><p>There, Dottie’s career began to take off in the mid-1960s, and it peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when she was Kenny Rogers’ duet partner. Dottie and Shelly’s father divorced in the early ‘70s. A tragic car accident claimed Dottie’s life in 1991 as she was on her way to a performance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-career></span><span>Shelly West Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is best known for her hit duets with David Frizzell, especially their No. 1 hit “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma”. She also was a successful solo artist, having her own No. 1 hit, “José Cuervo” in 1983. She reunited with Frizzell for a few shows in the late 1980s. West married Gary Hood in 1984 and had twin sons. In 1990, Shelly toured with her mother, Dottie West; together, they were popular on the road.</p><p>In late 1991, Dottie was involved in a major car accident, eventually dying on September 4, 1991, from injuries sustained in the accident. West was a technical adviser for a television biopic about her mother’s life, Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story, produced by and starring actress Michele Lee. At that point, amidst major changes in the country music industry that impacted the careers of many established country stars, the younger West retired to focus on her family.</p><p>In June 2005, CMT honored Shelly and her duet partner, David Frizzell, when they were voted No. 6 on their 100 Greatest Duets Special. Although they did not perform any songs, Shelly and David Frizzell appeared on the special, for which West was interviewed. West appeared on numerous episodes of Country Family Reunion on RFD-TV.</p><p>West has returned to performing occasionally since 2012. She reunited with David Frizzell for two shows on October 13, 2012, at the God & Country Theater in Branson, Missouri. The duo played another show on November 2, 2013, at the Americana Theater in Branson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-net-worth></span><span>Shelly West Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of 3 million dollars as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-married></span><span>Shelly West Married</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shelly first married David Frizzell’s younger brother “Allen Frizzell who played guitar in her mother’s band. Shelly and Allen married each other in 1977, so David was Shelly’s brother-in-law. Shelly and Allen divorced in 1985. She then married stage producer Garry Hood. That marriage too later ended in divorce. As Shelly focused on raising her children from both marriages, she put her music career off to the side. However, she toured with her mother during 1990 the year before Dottie’s death</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-and-david-frizzell></span><span>Shelly West and David Frizzell</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shelly began singing with her mother’s roadshow while a teenager. Interestingly, her own career began to peak at the same time that her mother was achieving her greatest success, as Rogers’ singing partner. Shelly too had found a singing partner, in David Frizzell.</p><p>In 1980, David and Shelly recorded a couple of songs together for a small label, including one titled “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma.” Clint Eastwood heard the song and liked it so much that he featured it in his comedy film Any Which Way You Can, which was released in late 1980.</p><p>Audiences also loved the song, and country radio stations began to play it. The song’s popularity then prompted Warner Brothers to sign West and Frizzell to a duet recording contract. The first result was the 1981 album Carryin’ On the Family Names, which included the hits “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma,” “A Texas State of Mind,” and “Husbands and Wives.” Shelly and David became in-laws in 1977 when shelly wedded David’s younger brother Allen Frizzell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shelly-west-%e2%80%9cjose-cuervo%e2%80%9d></span><span>Shelly West “Jose Cuervo”</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“José Cuervo” is a song written and recorded by Cindy Jordan in 1982. It was released as a single by Shelly&nbsp; in February 1983. The song hit No. 1 on the Country charts and was West’s second (and last) No. 1 since 1981’s duet with David Frizzell, “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma”. The song provided a sales boost for the Jose Cuervo tequila company and brought even more success to West. The song was released on her first solo album “West by West”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqLWmuMuyZLCdo6l6o7XOZpignV2dsqqzx61kqaCfqbxussCmoKWxXZius7HEq5uorKSesm7DxKyrZpyRq7alecWroLOylaG5brbOrJxmm6Wav7e7jKGsrJqRo7FuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sheryl-leach-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheryl Leach Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
