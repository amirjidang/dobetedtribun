That season, he took about seven podium positions including his double victory at the Monza and finishing as a runner up behind Koiranen GP's Nyck de Vries at the championship. At the final race of the season, he won the Junior Championship title at Jerez where he bested Russian teenager Matevos Isaakyan. He also took part in the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 season as a guest driver with Fortec. Out of six races, he finished on the podium three times and took the second place at the NÃ¼rburgring.</p><h2 id=formula-3-and-formula-2-championship>Formula 3 and Formula 2 Championship</h2><p>He moved on to start racing for the Formula Three in 2015 entering the FIA Formula 3 European Championship with the Dutch team Van Amersfoort Racing. During the opening round of the season, he inherited the pole position for the 2nd and 3rd races of that weekend after the original pole sitter Felix Rosenqvist was excluded due to the technical infringement issues. He then took his first race victory at the 3rd race of the weekend. He then took his 2nd victory the following round when he won the third race at the Hockenheim. At this point, he was already making a name for his name and a lot of F1 fans are anticipating him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After numerous titles won at the Formula Three, it was announced that he will be graduating to the Formula 2 after his victory at the GP3 title race. He entered the 2017 season with Prema Racing of Formula 2 with Ferrari junior and fellow GP3 racer Antonio Fuoco. He finally made his debut <a href=#>at the Bahrain race </a>where he took the pole position for feature race however he only finished third. In the sprint race, his team chose to take the mid race pit stop which is deemed uncommon for the shorter sprint races. He had to push harder on his Pirelli tyres which created a nine-second lead before the pitting. He took the victory upon overtaking Luca Ghiotto at the final lap. He went on to join and win numerous races after his victory taking the pole position. At his fourth race as the pole sitter held at the Azerbaijan, he dedicated his game to his late father Herve. The game was converted into another win for him and although the race was red-flagged five laps before its scheduled end.</p><h2 id=formula-one-career-with-haas-sauber-and-ferrari>Formula One Career with Haas, Sauber and Ferrari</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before entering Formula One, he was a test driver for Haas in 2016. He joined the Ferrari Driver Academy and acted as the development driver for the Haas F1 team and the Scuderia Ferrari. Part of his role as the development driver was to participate at the first practice session of British and German Grand Prix driving for the Haas team.

However it was not the case as he test drive for the Sauber team at the Malaysian Grand Prix in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He started <a href=#>racing for the Sauber team</a> at the Chinese Grand Prix in 2018.

This was his first appearance as MonÃ©gasque Formula One driver which did not happen since the last appearance of Olivier Beretta in 1994. Things might be going great for him unfortunately, at his first home race in the Formula One, he suffered brake failure at the closing laps which resulted in his vehicle colliding into the back of the car of Brendon Hartley which forced both of their cars to retire.</p><p>He moved on to a different team the following year when he signed with Scuderia Ferrari for the Chinese Grand Prix in 2019. He replaced the World Champion Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen who then took his place at Sauber and is now called the Alfa Romeo team.
