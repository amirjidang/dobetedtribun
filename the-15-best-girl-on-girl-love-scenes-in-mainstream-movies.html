That may be a bit crass but it’s there, appealing to men for centuries and more than a few women as well. In the early days of movies, it was all subtext, hard to truly showcase it in any way but as time has gone by, movies have been able to showcase more and more to show the full experience. Naturally, it’s popular in low-ranked movies like the classic “direct to video” genre and such flicks, more for exploitation than really serving the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But mainstream movies have been better showcasing some hot scenes, many truly amazing not just for the obvious passion but well-shot and acted out. These aren’t just brief lesbian moments like <a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> and <a href=#>Selma Blair</a> kissing in Cruel Intentions. These are for mainstream movies that boasted some amazingly well done girl-on-girl love scenes often featuring major actresses. While some may see it as exploitative, they are so well made that you can appreciate them no matter your sexuality and how Hollywood can truly honor, not trivialize, such a pairing while still making it steamy to see.</p><h2 id=15-wild-things><strong>15. Wild Things</strong></h2><p>via youtube.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the producers no doubt hoped this 1998 thriller would be a hit because of its plot, its success is due to its hot actresses getting together. <a href=#>Matt Dillon</a> is a teacher accused of assaulting&nbsp;two students (<a href=#>Denise Richards</a> and <a href=#>Neve Campbel</a>l) but Campbell's character admits on the stand that rich-girl Richards thought this up as payback for a bad grade. Dillon is freed and wins millions in a settlement… at which point it turns out the trio were in this together for a huge scam. From there, so many double and triple crosses abound that you need a scorecard to keep track.</p><p>What works are the two hot scenes, first when the two women have a threesome with Dillon. Later, we see Richards and Campbell having an argument poolside that ends with them falling into the pool, slapping each other but then making out, sharing hot kisses before tearing at each other’s clothes. While it’s short, it’s hot thanks to Richards and Campbell and how well they throw into it all.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-when-night-is-falling><strong>14. When Night is Falling</strong></h2><p>via vodkaster.com</p><p>This Canadian drama focuses on a professor (Pascale Bussieres) at a religious college who runs into a young circus performer (Rachael Crawford) who helps her cope with a personal tragedy. Crawford pursues her target, complete with firing an arrow with an invitation note through her window and a massage for an injured leg that quickly becomes sensual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They finally hook up at Crawford’s circus trailer; the scenes are shot in tight close-ups that enhance the encounter, with both women giving their all. They mix together very well, spicing up the movie in a way that makes you realize why it had an R rating. While the rest of the film is so-so, that wild encounter is easily the reason to watch as a reminder of how hot the Great White North can get.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-gia><strong>13. Gia</strong></h2><p>via joblo.com</p><p>This 1998 HBO movie is what truly launched <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> to stardom. She plays the title role of Gia Marie Carangi, considered the first modern super-model with various covers in the 1970s and ‘80s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a wild child herself, Jolie was well suited for the part, showing the reckless side of Gia and her desire to live life to the fullest no matter what. While she’s bisexual, her lesbian feelings are on full display for a segment where she agrees to pose nude for a photographer only if his makeup girl, Linda, stays to watch. Soon Linda is intrigued by Gia’s bold nude shoot and undresses herself, with the two sharing kisses through the fence Gia is posing on. It then cuts to them in bed together, Jolie clearly the aggressor with no problems showing off but Mitchell answering well.</p><p>The send-off is funny with Jolie in the hallway stark naked trying to talk Mitchell into staying. They have another hot encounter later on in the shower that’s as steamy as it sounds and both times, Jolie is totally believable going with a lady and pushing the fantastic style that’s made her a Hollywood icon.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-high-art><strong>12. High Art</strong></h2><p>via flavorwire.com</p><p>A popular art house hit in 1998, this drama begins with Ally Sheedy as a drug-using artist making out with model Patricia Clarkson. Sheedy soon meets photo editor Radha Mitchell and the two immediately bond. Their eventual sex scene is well done, Mitchell tentative as it’s her first time and the usually aggressive Sheedy holding back a bit to ease her into it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s wonderfully convincing and well shot as they move around the bed together and it’s a good touch how Sheedy responds faster as Mitchell gets more into it. It’s not just a “lesbian movie” but a well-done personal drama of artists’ lives but that hot scene does showcase how Sheedy is far greater a talent than most give her credit for and how well she and Mitchell click on screen.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-a-girl-thing><strong>11. A Girl Thing</strong></h2><p>via screenmusings.org</p><p>An HBO anthology film, this follows the lives of the various patients of a psychiatrist (Stockard Channing) as they handle things. Supermodel <a href=#>Elle Macpherson</a> plays a lawyer who’s insecure about herself and unable to put her own personal life over her career. She agrees to go on a double date with a co-worker’s friend that doesn’t go well. She ends up sharing drinks with the other woman involved in the date, played by Kate Capshaw and the two find a connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They banter on walks and at a club before finally getting together and it is amazing. Macphearson reminds you why she was nicknamed “The Body” with her stunning curves, with the two mixing together by candlelight that adds to the already intense heat. It’s a truly amazing sequence where both women give their all.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-blue-is-the-warmest-color><strong>10. Blue is the Warmest Color</strong></h2><p>via phf.upenn.edu</p><p>This acclaimed 2013 French film stars Lea Seydoux as the blue-haired woman who catches the eye of a young student played by Adele Exarchopoulos. The two are soon connecting with each other and the movie explores their lives as lovers. The love scenes are raw and stunning, with positions you’d never imagine and shot with a feeling like you’re right there, hot and yet also intimate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actresses are obviously well into it as they go on, moving from the heat of initial lust to more comfortable as they become a couple. The movie follows their relationship through to its sad end but still hopeful for both women as they realize they share a connection that will never go away. It’s still a stunning achievement that provides one of the most realistic depictions of girl-on-girl sex on film while still working as a fine drama in its own right.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-mulholland-drive><strong>9. Mulholland Drive</strong></h2><p>via mumbyatthemovies.blogspot.com</p><p>Even by his own standards, <a href=#>David Lynch</a>’s 2001 film is weird as hell. Supposedly, it was the pilot for an ABC series that Lynch later reworked but it’s hard to imagine any network able to use something so bizarre.</p><p>In her breakout role, <a href=#>Naomi Watts </a>is Betty, a bright-eyed gal coming to Los Angeles to find fame and fortune. She runs into Rita (Laura Harring), an amnesiac who appeared to survive a murder attempt and is hiding out while trying to figure out what to do next. The two women are soon on a search for answers that leads to a murder and an ending that has confounded viewers ever since its release. But before that, we get the big addition to the theatrical version as a naked Harring comes to Watts in bed and soon joins her. It’s both funny (“Have you ever done this before?” “I can’t remember”) and romantic, Lynch shooting in nicely as they come together, two odd spirits uniting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another scene takes place in the strange finale that both actresses handle with slightly different personas but either way the image of the blonde and brunette going at it is a reason a movie so damn strange remains a must-watch.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-better-than-chocolate><strong>8. Better Than Chocolate</strong></h2><p>via imglop.com</p><p>A popular film with lesbian audiences, this 1999 drama features Karyn Dwyer as a single gal who connects with Christina Cox’s artist. The two soon gel together with a moment of covering their naked bodies in paint and rolling around on a canvas. Their first few attempts are blocked by comedic stuff like Cox’s trailer carted away but they finally do connect while at a club, stealing away to the ladies’ room for a hot encounter.</p><p>It’s a classic “sex in the restroom” scene with Cox nicely selling the ecstasy of Dwyer kissing her down and the realistic touch of women overhearing them and just smiling to enjoy the show. The rest of the film nicely showcases their growing relationship amid various issues that shows how nicely done that hot encounter is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-chloe><strong>7. Chloe</strong></h2><p>via imagozone.com</p><p><a href=#>Julianne Moore</a> is well known for giving her all in her roles so it’s no surprise this 2009 film comes off so well. She plays a doctor convinced her husband (<a href=#>Liam Neeson</a>) is having an affair so she hires a call girl (<a href=#>Amanda Seyfried</a>) to “test” his commitment. It works as Seyfried tells Moore about their encounters with Moore clearly aroused by the idea of her husband with this younger woman.</p><p>As they meet again and again, it becomes obvious that Moore is less upset about Seyfried being with her husband and more that Seyfried isn’t with her. It finally comes to a steamy encounter with Seyfried laying kisses on Moore’s neck, the elder woman giving in and we see them in bed together making out. Both actresses are wonderful selling the passion, especially Moore; that scene elevates this unique drama to very fun heights of watching.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-if-these-walls-could-talk-2><strong>6. If These Walls Could Talk 2</strong></h2><p>via nydailynews.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This 2000 HBO movie is an anthology of three tales of lesbian relationships in different times and boasts not one but two very notable sex scenes. First, <a href=#>Michelle Williams</a> plays a feminist lesbian in the 1960s whose group mocks <a href=#>Chloe Sevingy</a>, who dresses in male clothes and plays up the butch idea. However, the two soon bond leading to a fine sex session in their bedroom with Sevingy the aggressor who slowly opens up while Williams responds wonderfully, all excellently shot to enhance the eroticism.</p><p>The second sequence takes place in modern times and features probably the last person you’d expect to provide a steamy love scene: <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>. She and <a href=#>Sharon Stone</a> play a couple trying to have a baby and their sex is the intimacy of couples but still amazingly hot as they go at it and sparking their segment nicely. Just goes to show how the unlikely candidates to get sexy can surprise you.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-head-in-the-clouds><strong>5. Head in the Clouds</strong></h2><p>via cinema.varmatin.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Penelope Cruz</a> and <a href=#>Charlize Theron</a>. Do you need to know more? This 2004 drama has Theron as a woman told by a fortuneteller she won’t live past 35 so lives things to the fullest. In 1930s Paris, she’s living with a former flame who’s dating his model (Cruz) and the trio soon are living together. The scene of Theron and Cruz sharing a dance in a club is practically a sex scene in itself as they get closer, exchanging smoldering glances before Cruz strips down for Theron and her boyfriend.</p><p>We see them in bed later, kissing about, dressed but still obviously passionate. It ends tragically and surprising two women so used to nudity keep the clothes on for this but still, the sight of these two incredibly hot ladies going at it together is the reason to check this movie out.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-desert-hearts><strong>4. Desert Hearts</strong></h2><p>via mubi.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Showtime created the lesbian drama The L Word, the producers had the actresses watch this 1985 movie for research. There’s a good reason for it as it showcases a wonderfully laid-out blossoming romance between Vivian (Helen Shaver), a divorced woman driving through the west in 1959 and Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), a free-spirited casino worker. In just a few meetings such as shopping in Reno, the connection is clear although both seem to want to deny it.</p><p>During a pouring rainstorm, they share a kiss but Shaver breaks it off to head to her hotel. Cay follows as the talk it over, Shaver telling herself this is a bad idea but when she steps into the bedroom, Charbonneau is already under the covers. The two proceed to have sex as hot as the Nevada desert, laying kisses all over each other. Both actresses give it their all, truly believable as two women erupting with odd passions. It's hot as hell yet it ties in to a real romantic tale that stands as a legend of lesbian-themed cinema and a good movie on its own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-black-swan><strong>3. Black Swan</strong></h2><p>via cacoamag.com</p><p>A fascinating psychological study, this 2010 movie features <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> in her Oscar-winning performance as an aspiring ballerina whose quest for fame drives her to a breakdown. She’s soon in competition for a key role with <a href=#>Mila Kunis </a>as a rival but the two start bonding over some partying and even drug use, which does little to help Portman’s state of mind.</p><p>Driving home from a club, Kunis rubs up and down Portman’s leg, driving her (and us) wild. In Portman’s apartment, they go at it, tearing off each other’s clothes, flopping on the bed and having a truly wild sequence. The fact that it’s revealed to all have been a dream does nothing to kill how hot an encounter it is and a highlight of an already fantastic film.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-bound><strong>2. Bound</strong></h2><p>via stonergirlsguide.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before they blew away moviegoers with The Matrix, the Wachowskis got attention for this 1996 crime thriller. Corky (Gina Gershon) is a recently paroled con, tough and hard with tattoos, recently hired as the handywoman for a building. Violet (Jennifer Tilly) is the moll of a small-time gangster (Joe Pantoliano) living in the building. Meeting in an elevator, it’s lust at first sight between the duo as Violet comes over to visit Corky with a bottle of wine.</p><p>Not 12 minutes into to the movie, we are thrust into one of the hottest, steamiest and most realistic&nbsp;girl-on-girl sex scenes ever filmed. The two women naked in bed, the camera sweeping around to capture every bit of it and the soundtrack pounding to mimic their feelings, it all comes together perfectly. Both women are amazing, Gershon as the tough gal while Tilly is smarter than she seems and when they’re together, it’s smoldering no matter what. There’s another love scene later in the film but not quite as well done as that opening, which launched the movie (and its creators) to great attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-the-hunger><strong>1. The Hunger</strong></h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>A groundbreaker in so many ways, Tony’s Scott’s 1983 film is a moody and gripping take on the vampire mythos as Catherine Deneuve is Miriam, an immortal vampire living in New York with her current companion David Bowie. However, Bowie realizes that Miriam lied to him as he does have eternal life but not eternal youth. He seeks out Sarah (Susan Sarandon), a blood specialist, leading to the stunning sequence where he ages forty years in just an hour in her waiting room. Eventually, he ends up with all of Miriam’s past companions, a living corpse locked in a coffin. Seeking answers, Sarah meets with Miriam and both women are intrigued with each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This sets up the sequence that has earned raves for over thirty years. The two women talk and chat, getting closer as Sarah spills wine onto her blouse. As Miriam watches, Sarah pulls her top off, revealing her amazing body. As the opera song “The Flower Duet” plays, the two women fall into bed with each other, satin curtains blocking some view but what we see still amazingly well done, the passion of the two women flowing off the screen, Scott giving it an air perfectly in tune with the music. It’s still a fantastic viewing thanks to the two women involved and a must-see for fans of lesbian cinema and horror films alike.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>gamesradar.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatoJVifnZ5wZ6qrWWXnr%2Btec6nZKChoqF6rbvVnmSsm5WjsrR5yKdkppmZo8C1vsSapGaln6u2pr%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-15-most-despicable-people-in-wwe-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 15 Most Despicable People In WWE History">&larr;
