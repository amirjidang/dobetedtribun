They seem to genuinely enjoy designing clothing and have several successful lines to prove it, from Elizabeth and James to The Row.</p><p>Of course, many people have been fans of the Olsens for a long time. And even though they don't want to share much about their lives with the public anymore, fans hope that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are both happy in their love lives. Ashley got married to Louis Eisner in 2022... but is Mary-Kate still in a relationship? After watching the twins act in so many movies for so many years, it's hard not be interested in their well-being.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/did-mary-kate-olsen-s-ex-husband-age-bother-the-rest-of-her-family_.jpg><p>In February 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate Olsen was linked to John Cooper</a>.

While Mary-Kate didn't say anything about dating Max Winkler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winkler talked about Mary-Kate</a> in an interview with New York Magazine. He said that he cared about Mary-Kate and not her fame. He explained, “I dated an Olsen twin because I was in with an Olsen twin. But I wasn't in love with her because she was ‘an Olsen twin.’ I just thought she was so pretty and smart and cute."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Katenberg and Mary-Kate stopped dating in 2004 because they were going to different colleges.

However, while a source told People that they were together, no one knows for sure. Mary-Kate hasn't ever commented on this potential romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Mary-Kate Olsen and John Cooper are still in a relationship, fans would love to know if they are happy. And if the Olsen twin is single, then hopefully she is enjoying this phase of her life. She hasn't spoken about her divorce, but since Sarkozy has kids, that couldn't have been easy. When Mary-Kate has been interviewed in the past few years, she has shared her love of design. At least fans know that she's at peace with the direction that her life and career have taken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWdlr%2B6ecqaq55ln6HAprqMrKuipJxisaLAyKeeZqKfnbtur86op56qXZaztbHRZp%2Beql2nvLazx2aboq6fp7Cmedaiq6Fln6G2t7XEq2SsmaKgvLvFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./isaac-wright-jr-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-90981-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Isaac Wright Jr Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
