Fans will remember their greatest hits from these albums. Here we show you the highest-grossing albums of all time that have made Metallica a legendary band.</p><h2 id=load-11-490-000>Load ($11,490,000)</h2><p><i></i></p><p><i>Load </i>was an <a href=#>album</a> of change that came out after a long gap of five years. The album created history in many ways because Metallica <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed their music</a> and style for this album. In terms of style, they cut their long strands and the music had blues and country influences. Many fans were unhappy with the change, but others embraced it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Anticipated Album Releases of 2015</a></span></p><p>Songs like “2x4” and “Mama Said” were totally different from the thrash music that Metallica was known for. The album still maintained its No.1 position on the Billboard charts and sold over 5 million copies and has grossed over $11,490,000. Some of the singles from this album include “Hero of the Day” and “Until it Sleeps.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=st-anger-5-050-000>St. Anger ($5,050,000)</h2><p>Not one of the more famous albums that Metallica came up with, but still a number one hit and double platinum to boot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>St. Anger</i></a> is an album with a lot of chaos attached to it. Jason Newsted, who was the bassist, left the band during this time. James Hetfield too was out for rehab and this led to the chaos. There was a lot of change in this album with no guitar solo performed. But with some good old music and singles like “Frantic,” the album did well eventually and has grossed over $5,050,000. Now it counts as the top ten highest-grossing Metallica albums of all time.</p><h2 id=reload-8-940-000>ReLoad ($8,940,000)</h2><p>After the release of the <i>Load </i>album, Metallica continued to create more singles that were then combined into the next series. This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new album was called "<i>ReLoad</i></a>" and Metallica preferred to call the two albums a single album. <i>Load </i>did very well in the Billboard charts and made a great deal of money, but <i>ReLoad </i>actually surpassed it a bit more. With singles like "Fuel," "The Unforgiven II," and "The Memory Remains," <i>ReLoad </i>really went on to be at the top of the charts and has grossed $8,940,000. In retrospect, fans realized that it was the last time <a href=#>Jason Newsted</a> appeared with the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=death-magnetic-5-330-000>Death Magnetic ($5,330,000)</h2><p>With <i>Death Magnetic</i>, Metallica seemed to come back to its roots and stick to thrash metal. Some found the loud music exceeded the standards, but fans clearly loved this and put the album on the top of the charts for a long time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">With <i>Death Magnetic</i></a>, the album became the 5th consecutive recording to be No.1 in the charts and has grossed over $5,330,000. Metallica was the first band to do this with each of their debut albums. Singles like "The Day That Never Comes" and "Cyanide" was much appreciated by their fans. Since these were songs that stuck to the genre of metal, the album made a huge impact.</p><h2 id=the-black-album-30-790-000>The Black Album ($30,790,000)</h2><p>In 1991, Metallica came up with their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best-selling album</a>, naming it <i>Metallica – The Black Album</i>. It became No. 1 on the Billboard charts and sold over 30 million copies worldwide. In the <a href=#>US</a> alone it made history when it sold over 16 million copies. Some of the best singles from this album are "Sad But True," "Enter Sandman," "Wherever I May Roam," and "The Unforgiven."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of The Biggest Music Album Flops Of 2014</a></span></p><p>The fantastic thing about this album is that it is still among the top 100 in the Billboard charts, even after 25 years of its release. No wonder <i>The Black Album</i> is such a legendary album from Metallica and has grossed over $30,790,000.</p><h2 id=hardwired-to-self-destruct-3-140-000>Hardwired…To Self Destruct ($3,140,000)</h2><p>The year 2016 turned out to be a great year for Metallic, after a lull of nearly eight years. They released their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">album <i>Hardwired... To Self Destruct</i></a>, which went on to go platinum on the Billboard charts. Singles from the album include "Moth into Flame," "Hardwired," "Atlas, Rise!" and "Spit Out the Bone.” The album helped to regain Metallica’s legendary power and fans just couldn’t get enough of it. It showed that even with a huge gap in performing, Metallica was here to stay in a grand way. <i>Hardwired... To Self Destruct</i> made its way to the top of the charts easily and has grossed nearly $3,140,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-justice-for-all-15-840-000>And Justice For All ($15,840,000)</h2><p>Jason Newsted joins Metallica and they came up with the album <i>And Justice for All</i>. The problem some critics felt with the album was that the performance of Jason Newsted was not up to the mark. Lengthy songs added to the criticism. Singles from the album include "To Live is to Die" and "One." Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>And Justice for All</i> was nominated</a> in 1989 for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, the Grammy that year actually went to Jethro Tull. Even with all the criticism, the album continued to be on the top of the charts and is one of the highest-grossers for Metallica, making over $15,840,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ride-the-lightning-11-740-000>Ride The Lightning ($11,740,000)</h2><p>Another of the greatest albums that Metallica <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put out is <i>Ride the Lightning</i></a>. This album showcased the legendary performances of every member of the band. From perfect lyrics to creative <a href=#>music</a>, Metallica was on top of their game with this album and their fans loved every single one of the performances. Their standout songs from the album are "Fight Fire with Fire," "Creeping Death," "For Whom the Bell Tolls," and "The Call of Ktulu." Each of these singles led the album to be the best when it came out at the time. Unknown to all, <i>Ride the Lightning</i> would again be overtaken by their next great album and gross nearly $11,740,000.</p><h2 id=kill-em-all-8-510-000>Kill "Em All ($8,510,000)</h2><p>One of the best albums that Metallica is known for to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this day is <i>Kill ‘Em All</i></a>. This cemented their raw talent with feral sound and the fans were all over it. Songs included in the album have ominous titles like "Seek and Destroy," "No Remorse," "Hit the Lights," and "Jump in the Fire." Even though many of the songs were written by Dave Mustaine, he was removed from the band while they were recording this particular album. His replacement, Kirk Hammett only had two weeks before having to perform in shows. <i>Kill ‘Em All</i> turned out to be an iconic album and has gone triple-platinum and has grossed about $8,510,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=master-of-puppets-13-980-000>Master Of Puppets ($13,980,000)</h2><p><i></i></p><p><i>Master of Puppets</i> is by far the best and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-grossing album of Metallica</a> and any other metal band in the world. The album is filled with great songs; youthfulness and the needed aggression for all thrash metal genre albums. The songs in this album include "Damage Inc." "Battery," "Welcome Home," and "Orion." This was also the last album that Cliff Burton would perform in before his demise in 1986. <i>Master of Puppets</i> is almost an homage to the thrash metal genre and Metallica as a band. It stays on top of the charts for 72 weeks and has grossed $13,980,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Christmas Albums That Shocked Us</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnZrBorjLopqaZZietKmx0q1koKqfqMCqusZmmKWapaLAbr7Ap6KenF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-richards-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-97362-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Richards Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
