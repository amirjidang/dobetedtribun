The cast has now all grown up and moved on with their careers, and yet I still find myself watching episodes on Netflix because it takes me back to a time when life seemed much less complicated. I guess not all the characters moved on, in fact, Topanga and Cory are back at it in Girl Meets World married and have children of their own. It’s a series that people weren’t sure would catch, but it did, people just can’t get enough of those characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boy Meets World was one of the greatest shows of our youth and even though it’s an older show it has better comedy than most of the shows they have out now. As a tween, you went through the same stages as the characters on the show and as they struggled you too felt like someone finally understood what you were going through. Girl Meets World can’t take the place of the show we grew up watching, and that’s why I still find myself tuning into old episodes. Boy Meets World showed us how the world could be cruel and damaging at times but yet did it in such a way that we could laugh about it after, it showed us that life doesn’t have to be that bad, that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>Throughout the series, there have been many guest stars that have come and gone in the series. As if the show wasn’t good enough already we had the opportunity of seeing other beloved characters join an already pretty great cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-keri-russell><strong>15. Keri Russell</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Keri Russell</a> is another actress in Hollywood that started out young but was able to break out of the child roles and move on to a successful career in Hollywood. At the beginning of her career, quite literally her second role ever she guest starred on Boy Meets World as Mr. Feeny’s niece. She had just come to town for a visit during the same episode that Rue McClanahan starred in. Shawn spent the whole episode trying to get her character to go out with them, and Mr. Feeny was dead set against it. I wonder why? Keri Russell got her big break when she starred in Felicity making her one of the most popular young actresses at the time. She has also starred in many movies such as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Mission Impossible III, and August Rush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-shane-west><strong>14. Shane West</strong></h2><p>Shane West played an important character in Boy Meets World even though he was only there for one episode. When he arrived in the 90’s, it was during an episode in which Topanga and Cory breakup. Now enter Nick as the heartthrob, and you get a mix of a new romance. In this episode, Topanga kisses another guy, and of course, that guy would be Shane West’s character Nick. It’s hard to imagine Topanga being with anyone else but Cory but alas she did try to move on to someone else. Shane West is most known for his roles in A Walk to Remember with <a href=#>Mandy Moore</a> and Whatever It Takes. What you may not know about Shane West is that he is also a songwriter as well as a punk rock musician. He has been focusing more on his singing career than he has on his acting career which may explain why we haven’t seen much of the actor lately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-larisa-oleynik><strong>13. Larisa Oleynik</strong></h2><p>Larisa Oleynik is another actress that has been in the business since she was a kid. She guest starred in Boy Meets World once as the character Dana Pruitt. Since then, however, she has been on many different shows and films. She is most known for her role as Cat’s annoying and pretentious sister on 10 Things I Hate About You as well as Maggie on Pretty Little Liars. She has also been seen on Mad Men, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and Hawaii 5-0. She’s one of those actresses that is easily recognized. Throughout her career you always find yourself saying, “Oh she was in that film or TV show.” She hasn’t done much acting in the past few years.</p><h2 id=12-lee-norris><strong>12. Lee Norris</strong></h2><p>There is no forgetting Lee Norris, these days he is most remembered for playing Mouth on One Tree Hill and also a recurring character on Girl Meets World. Though he has been in a few movies as well such as Gone Girl, Zodiac, and American Gothic. He’s been in the industry since he was a kid and although he has never been considered a big star, we still love to see him pop up every now and then. He played Minkus in Boy Meets World for five years on the show. He came in as a guest star, but they liked him so much that he stayed. His character was that of the nerdy classmate that sat near Topanga and Cory. He continued to play the same role in Girl Meets World but as a grown up. He has also guest starred in other popular TV shows such as Dawson’s Creek&nbsp;and Surf School.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-mena-suvari><strong>11.&nbsp;Mena Suvari</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mena Suvari</a> has done quite well in Hollywood; she was another child star that was able to break the mold and go into adult acting. She is most known for her roles in the American Pie franchise as well as American Beauty. She got her first role, however, playing the role of Hillary on Boy Meets World. She was only there for a few episodes in the 1990’s, but it’s still fun to look back. She is barely recognizable as a child compared to how she looks now, but she is still unforgettable. After she had got her first role, she went on to star in many more roles. She has been involved in the TV series Clarence for the past two years and when 2017 rolls around we will be seeing her in series such as American Woman and Justice League Action.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-brittany-murphy><strong>10. Brittany Murphy</strong></h2><p>Who doesn’t love <a href=#>Brittany Murphy</a>? That adorable smile that just won the world over. In Boy Meets World Brittany was only there for a handful of episodes during Season three. She played Topanga’s brutally annoying best friend, which is odd why they didn’t keep her around. I can’t even remember Topanga having another best friend after that. Brittany moved on to play many roles most notably 8 Mile, Clueless and Happy Feet. She was quite popular in the 90’s, and her career seemed to be booming. She played <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>’s wife in Just Married, and he said he would always consider her to be his first wife. She also played alongside <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> in Girl Interrupted making us never want to eat chicken again. Brittany died tragically 2009, at the alarmingly young age of 32 of pneumonia though there is still a lot of speculation around her death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-rue-mcclanahan><strong>9. Rue McClanahan</strong></h2><p>Rue McClanahan is most known for her role as Blanche in Golden Girls, another beloved show that went on for many years. In Boy Meets World Rue played Cory’s grandmother and was only there for one episode. She used to hail about how she used to be part of the Rolling Stones; it can only mean that she was a groupie at the time. She makes a promise to Cory to do something fun while she is there but instead ends up leaving early causing Cory great disappointment. Rue started her career off as a New York stage actress and then moved on to TV. She is most known for her roles in Golden Girls as well as the Touched by an Angel series; she spent almost ten years on. Rue died on June 3, 2010, at the age of 76 but worked all the way up until a year before her death.</p><h2 id=8-jennifer-love-hewitt><strong>8. Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong></h2><p>Talk about a girl that can melt hearts everywhere. <a href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt </a>has been in the acting game for many years and has been considered to be one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood. She starred in an episode of Boy Meets World during season five, and she looked as great as ever. She actually poked fun at the character she played in I Know What You Did Last Summer by playing a character on the show called Jennifer Love Fefferman. She, of course, is known for her roles in the I Know What You Did Last Summer franchise as well as the Ghost Whisperer. She has had a great career landing leading roles in series such as Hot in Cleveland and The Client List. Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-kristanna-loken><strong>7. Kristanna Loken</strong></h2><p>You may remember her from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines as one of the badass terminators. She gave a new meaning to Terminator as a sexy, kick-ass killing machine. As a teen, however, she played one of Shawn’s girlfriends though she was only around for two episodes. Her name was Jennifer Bassett, and she dated Shawn but was one of his worst girlfriends as she didn’t treat him very well. She eventually dumped Shawn, and after overhearing Cory insulting her, she went about seeking revenge. Before breaking up with Shawn, she insisted that he end his friendship with Cory in order to keep her. At first, he chooses the girl because he’s thinking with his “other brain” but in the end makes the right decision to keep his friend. She has since appeared in other shows including Girl Meets World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-the-monkees><strong>6. The Monkees</strong></h2><p>The Monkees were quite the iconic band in their day, and they are legends in ours. They were a popular 1960’s pop band that had a huge fan base. During season three The Monkees guest-starred on Boy Meets World during the episode “Rave On.” You may think that they were the band The Monkees on the episode but hilariously enough they were not. Micky Dolenz actually played a friend of Alan’s while Davy Jones was a long time moocher that Amy and Alan knew from college. Peter Tork played Topanga’s father, though, throughout the series, there were three different actors that did so. Not all of The Monkees appeared on the episode however, Mike Nesmith declined to appear on the show. He was still focusing on his music career and had other things going on at the time. It was a fun episode especially since you got to see the musicians in other roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-melissa-joan-hart><strong>5. Melissa Joan Hart</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Melissa Joan Hart </a>was a fun character that guest starred on Boy Meets World and when she did so she was the character from another TV series Sabrina, The Teenage Witch. Shawn had just dealt with one “witch” in his life and ended up going on a date with Sabrina not realizing that she too was a witch. She played the role on Boy Meets World while she was still working on her TV series. She also acted in a few movies, most notably Drive Me Crazy as well as starring in <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>' video, “My Prerogative.” She also starred in a reality series for five years called Melissa & Joey with Joey Lawrence. Since then she hasn’t been in the limelight very much, just a few guest spots here and there and a role in&nbsp;God's&nbsp;Not Dead 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-candace-cameron><strong>4. Candace Cameron</strong></h2><p>Candace Cameron is most known for her role on Full House, which she spent most of her childhood and teenage years on. She also moved on to play in the new and improved Fuller House. As a teenager, she starred in an episode of Boy Meets World, the same episode that Melissa Joan Hart starred in. She played the college girl that was actually a witch. She started to date Eric’s roommate and was very controlling. It turned out that she was more than just some possessive girlfriend she really wanted to sacrifice him to the Devil. It was a fun episode for Halloween, and it showed the true friendship between two roommates. Candace Cameron stayed out of the limelight after Full House and almost disappeared for while. She has been acting regularly however in the past few years though there have never been any big roles. Personally, I thought she got out of acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-robert-goulet><strong>3. Robert Goulet</strong></h2><p>Robert Goulet had a guest spot on Boy Meets World playing, who else? Himself! Who can blame the guy, that’s the only person he’s ever wanted to represent. He was known to be a handsome and charismatic celebrity and a generally well-liked human. Now, was his appearance on Boy Meets World better than the Emerald Nuts commercial he did? How could anything be better than that? Robert had a steady career in Hollywood and never seemed to slow down as he loved his job. He’s most known for his role on The Love Boat as well as Fantasy Island. Although he has been in many different movies and TV shows, he was never considered to be a big name actor. Sadly, the actor died at the age of 73 on October 30, 2007.</p><h2 id=2-ted-lange-amp-bernie-kopell><strong>2. Ted Lange & Bernie Kopell</strong></h2><p>These two are beloved characters well known for their time on the TV series The Love Boat. The two appeared together in an episode of Boy Meets World as themselves. They were hired to pretend they were alum members of a fraternity that Eric had set up to get girls. After their little stint there Cory also hired them to listen to his mother tell stories about himself. In the end, the actors felt like they were being held captive by the family. It was a fun episode and one that really reminded us of why we love The Love Boat so much. Bernie Kopell played the doctor on the boat and these days he is focusing more on relaxing and doing celebrity tennis tournaments. He had a guest appearance on Raising Hope and due to his appearance on The Love Boat he can still get a table at any restaurant he desires. Ted Lange is currently writing screenplays and directing plays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-adam-scott><strong>1. Adam Scott</strong></h2><p>Adam Scott is one person that I don’t remember appearing on the show, I actually had to look it up. He’s done quite well in his career appearing in many movies and TV shows. He played a bully in Boy Meets World and came back for more than one appearance. He was in both the second and the third season of the show going up against the main characters repeatedly. He’s most known for his role on Parks and Recreation as Ben Wyatt. He also starred alongside his Parks and Recreation co-star Amy Poehler in the film A.C.O.D in 2013. Adam Scott plays a really good bully and he’s been the “bad guy” in multiple roles, he just has the face for it. He did well as the character in Boy Meets World, and the producers loved him so much that they brought him back for another season.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>biography.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYrS2sdKtZKyskae%2FprCMqKVmmp%2Bueq6xxK2qZq%2Bfp7mlew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dwayne-rock-johnson-reasons-future-oscar-winner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Reasons Why The Rock Will Win An Oscar In The Next Three Years">&larr;
