Hasse, a German brewer, established the Moctezuma Brewery in Veracruz, Mexico, and began producing a Vienna-style lager called “Siglo XX” to commemorate the approaching 20th century. Later, the beer was rebranded as Dos Equis, which means “two Xs” in Spanish, symbolizing the Roman numeral “XX”.</p><p>Throughout the years, Dos Equis has gained significant popularity and global recognition as one of Mexico’s finest beer brands. Its ownership has undergone several changes due to mergers and acquisitions, ultimately falling under the helm of Heineken International in 2010.</p><p>Today, Dos Equis is celebrated for its exceptional Mexican-style lagers and remains an enduring symbol of quality and craftsmanship in the beer industry.</p><h2>The Ownership Journey of Dos Equis</h2><p>The history of <b>Dos Equis ownership</b> has been marked by significant changes over time. In 1985, Heineken, the Dutch brewing company, acquired a minority stake in the Moctezuma Brewery, the parent company of Dos Equis. Gradually, Heineken increased its share, eventually leading to the full acquisition in 2010. This acquisition also encompassed the Mexican beer operations of FEMSA, the former parent company of Moctezuma Brewery.</p><p>As a result, Dos Equis came under the ownership of Heineken International. Today, Dos Equis is managed and operated by the <b>Heineken Group</b>, which is globally recognized as one of the largest and most prominent beer brands.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dos-Equis-ownership-1024x585.jpg alt="Dos Equis ownership" title="Dos Equis ownership" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“The acquisition of Dos Equis by Heineken has contributed to the brand’s continued success and global recognition”</p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Key Events</th></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>Heineken acquires a minority stake in Moctezuma Brewery, Dos Equis’ parent company</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Heineken completes the full acquisition of Dos Equis and FEMSA’s Mexican beer operations</td></tr><tr><td>Present</td><td>Dos Equis is owned and operated by the <b>Heineken Group</b></td></tr></table><p>Under the ownership of Heineken, Dos Equis has continued to flourish as a beloved beer brand, known for its quality and unique Mexican-style lagers.
