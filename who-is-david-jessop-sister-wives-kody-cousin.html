Some people have come and gone, while others have stuck around for several seasons. At the very beginning of the show, a new wife was brought on board. This wife had previously been married and came to the Brown family with three children from that relationship.</p><p>Out of all the people that have come into the show, one that fans don't hear about is the biological father of Robyn Brown's oldest children and the husband of her first marriage. Who is this individual, and what role does he play within the family outside of being an ex-husband and father? Since Robyn has remarried, what has become of her first husband?</p><h2 id=robyn-brown-was-previously-married-to-david-jessop>Robyn Brown Was Previously Married To David Jessop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/l-intro-1611084235.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Robyn Brown was just 21 years old, she married David Jessop in Montana. The couple went on to have three children (Dayton, Aurora, and Brianna) before separating in 2007.</p><p>Their divorce was finalized in 2009, and <a href=#>Robyn met and spiritually married Kody Brown</a> the following year, in 2010. She then gave birth to their first child together, Solomon, in 2011.</p><p>Later on, in 2014, the two entered into a legal marriage in order for Kody to be able to adopt Robyn's older children. To do this, Kody had to legally divorce his first wife, Meri, and enter into a union with her that was merely spiritual.</p><p>Both Christine and Janelle were spiritually married to Kody as well. Robyn and Kody welcomed the youngest Brown child, Ariella, two years after legally marrying.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Amid Rumors That Sister Wives Is Being Canceled, How Will The Browns Support Themselves?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whereas Robyn's first marriage was monogamous, her second marriage was polygamous, with three sister wives and many children in an already functional family. This shift for both the current and new family members was substantial, although Robyn herself is a child of plural marriage.</p><p>Her mother was a sister wife in her own regard, although they lived in separate homes and rarely interacted, per previous reports by Robyn. Therefore, while Robyn was part of a family rooted in plural marriage, the organization was much different than what the Brown family and other Mormon polygamous groups demonstrate.</p><h2 id=jessop-is-related-to-two-other-brown-family-members>Jessop Is Related to Two Other Brown Family Members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screen-shot-2020-03-09-at-5-07-57-am-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While David Jessop is the ex-husband of Robyn Brown and the biological father to her three oldest children, he is more intermixed in the family than just that one relationship.</p><p>Not only is he a third cousin to the family patriarch Kody Brown, but David Jessop is also a first cousin to Christine, the mother of six of Kody's children Aspyn, Mykelti, Paedon, Gwendlyn, Ysabel, and Truely.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sister Wives' Kody Brown Keep TLC From Paying for Daughter Ysabel's Scoliosis Surgery?</a></span></p><h2></h2><p>There are many nuances within the Mormon religion and polygamous culture that dictate who can rightfully be married to one another. Because of these stipulations, there are often common ancestors that span across different extensions of the family.</p><p>While in monogamous marriages, it may seem odd to have a cousin in common or marry an ex-husband's family member, this isn't the case when it comes to Mormonism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-david-jessop-today>Where Is David Jessop Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/It-Is-Believed-That-Kody-Married-Robyn-For-The-Sake-Of-Her-Children-via-youtube.com-TLC-channel.jpg><p>Although it's well documented through the family's famous reality television series Sister Wives that the <a href=#>Brown family is going through a rough patch</a>, not much is mentioned about David Jessop in the news or otherwise.</p><p>It was said on an early episode of the show that Robyn's oldest children, whom she shares with Jessop, were regularly visiting their father; it appears that those stopped a few years into Robyn's marriage to Kody.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did The Sister Wives' Weight Loss Stem From A Questionable MLM Scheme?</a></span></p><p>Sources say Jessop initially approached Kody about pursuing a stepparent adoption to alleviate child support obligations. However, the conversation stopped when Jessop learned that such a change would come with visitation rights being removed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it hasn't been confirmed, some speculate that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kody moved forward with the idea</a>, and the courts sided with him after Jessop's lapse in support payments for an extended time.</p><p>Robyn Brown has made statements in the past that alluded to David Jessop being abusive and acting in a bullying manner towards her and her children during their marriage. While this accusation was never corroborated, Jessop was arrested for domestic assault in August 2018.</p><p>While the charge was eventually lowered to disorderly conduct and Jessop was required to pay fines, the incident seems to further cement Robyn's claims about her tumultuous and problematic eight-year relationship that she had with him.</p><p>Outside those events, other news has come out about Robyn Brown's ex. Unfortunately, in February 2023, it was disclosed that David Jessop, who more commonly goes by his middle name of Preston, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was diagnosed with Leukemia</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unknown whether his oldest children with Robyn are aware or if they have been in contact with their father since the cancer was discovered. The GoFundMe that his sister-in-law set up indicates that Jessop has remarried and has four children with his new wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMCvoJ1lmprAtLvPZqqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWbpLG6ecKorKyhnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-nickslots-everything-on-his-wikipedia-and-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Nickslots?
