This was exciting news for emo <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> fans who have been wondering <a href=#>where the beloved band went</a> after breaking up in 2013. A few years ago, band members Frank Iero, Ray Toro, and brothers Mikey Way and Gerard Way seemed ready for a comeback. But as fans know, things didn't work out that easily for them.</p><p>When a band promises a tour or new album and it gets pushed back, there could be any number of explanations. There's one main reason behind My Chemical Romance's decision to reschedule several tour dates. Here's whether Mikey and Gerard Way's brotherly bond had anything to do with it...</p><h2 id=why-did-my-chemical-romance-39-s-comeback-take-such-a-long-time>Why Did My Chemical Romance's Comeback Take Such A Long Time?</h2><p>Many bands had to postpone tours in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some weren't even sure that they would be able to reschedule for the summer of 2021. In some cases, fans waited two or three years to be able to see their favorite musicians perform again. This is the reason why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Chemical Romance delayed their tour</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Mikey Way told Radio 1 Newsbeat that the band would be back. He was compassionate about the tough situation and said that he wasn't the only person who had to change what he was doing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/my-chemical-romance-including-bob-bryar.jpg><p>Mikey explained, "Whether you're in a band, you're a director, you work a retail job, you're a gardener - you had a plan, and now it's been disrupted. Live music isn't going anywhere, it's just on pause for everybody. I feel like people are waiting with bated breath. It's a light at the end of the tunnel and I think there's something really cool about that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>One Of My Chemical Romance's Most Iconic Music Videos Was Absolutely Disastrous For The Band Members, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>The My Chemical Romance Reunion Tour did happen in the spring, summer, and fall of 2022.

They played countless shows to adoring crowds of fans who were definitely glad to see them again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/my-chemical-romance-s-gerard-way-looking-shocked.jpg><p>Fans and critics raved about the My Chemical Romance Reunion Tour, and it seems like it was really fun to see the band performing again.</p><h2 id=did-mikey-way-and-gerard-way-39-s-relationship-impact-my-chemical-romance-39-s-comeback>Did Mikey Way And Gerard Way's Relationship Impact My Chemical Romance's Comeback?</h2><p>It doesn't appear that My Chemical Romance's comeback was affected by the relationship between Mikey Way and Gerard Way. In fact, they have always appeared to get along well. It sounds like the band was excited to perform together again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mikey-way.jpg><p>My Chemical Romance's history is fascinating because they have broken up and gotten back together a few times. They decided to stop performing and playing together in 2013. The band then got back together to perform in Los Angeles in 2019.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Umbrella Academy' Creator Gerard Way Pays Heartwarming Tribute To MCR Stage Manager Jacob Raggio</a></span></p><p>Whenever My Chemical Romance has broken up, Mikey Way and Gerard Way have been honest about how they were feeling at the time.</p><p>In 2019, Gerard Way spoke to The Guardian about the band breaking up in 2013. He said, “It wasn’t fun to make stuff any more. I think breaking up the band broke us out of that machine.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard also said that it was hard to achieve so much success because people would always tell them what they should do. It sounds like he felt like he wasn't able to do what he really wanted. He said in his interview with The Guardian, "When things start to succeed and go really well, that’s when a lot of people start to have an opinion and that’s when you run into struggle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/my-chemical-romance.jpg><p>He explained that when My Chemical Romance put out their third album, "The Black Parade," in 2006, that was a challenging time. He told The Guardian, “everybody had a f*cking opinion about what MCR should be. So it made it difficult to figure out what direction to take next. You get caught up in this trap of ‘Is it ever gonna be good enough?’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Drake's Touring Earnings Are Absolutely Record Breaking, Here's The Truth About His Most Profitable Performances</a></span></p><p>While My Chemical Romance put off their comeback tour because of the pandemic, this wasn't the first time that the band went through some major changes. In 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikey Way quit My Chemical Romance</a> and said that he needed to focus on his personal life.</p><p>According to The Guardian, Mikey was interested in being at home with his first wife, Alicia Simmons, instead of touring and performing all the time.</p><p>Gerard Way shared the news with the band's fans and said, "I'm very proud to announce my brother's recent marriage. Watching him grow up into a man and finding love makes me the happiest brother alive. In light of this joyous event, the band has decided to give he and his wife a much needed break from the road to start a life and have a proper honeymoon and do all of the things a newlywed couple should do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that marriage didn't last and Mikey married his second wife Kristin Blanford in 2016, Gerard's statement suggests that he and his brother Mikey Way get along. Gerard seemed to understand what Mikey needed at that time in his life and was very caring toward him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gerard-way.jpg><p>In 2011, the brothers were interviewed by Kerrang! Magazine, and they talked about their relationship. It doesn't seem that they have ever had any trouble. They said that they originally wanted to call the band My Chemical Brothers, which is definitely proof of their love for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard said, "Mikey's always got my back. He's one of the most supportive people in my life alongside my wife. Anything I want to do, he's there for me: from working on a drawing as a kid, to what we do now. And I've always tried to be there for him. Knowing there's somebody out there who has so much trust in what you do is great." He also said during the interview, "If my brother hadn't been in this band when I started it, I don't know if I'd have got through it all."</p><p>Mikey told the publication, "He's my best friend and he understands me like nobody else on earth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumqtdosZur8eepKKbkaF6s7vMmqWcnaNisLC5xJuYnKNdmLyuvMuimpqslZl6o8WMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZpqVqcSmsc1mmaunpJ2ys7%2BMpqCknalirq%2BwjKCcq5mimXq4rdho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-ryan-oreilly-and-wife-dayna-douros-age-difference-nhl-players-love-life-explored-308793-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Ryan OReilly And Wife Dayna Douros Age Difference?
