They may come and go faster than we'd like, but every surgeon hired there is downright gorgeous. We're talking both the men and the women. That being said, a lot of the dreamy male doctors employed at Grey Sloan bring more than just their looks to the table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, we are going to be remembering all of our favorite male doctors, past and present,&nbsp; and ranking them in order of who we'd actually want to date. Now, some of them may be fun to watch on screen, but that doesn't necessarily mean we'd be lining up to get involved in one of their weird love triangles...</p><h2 id=owen-hunt-has-proven-he-s-not-dating-material><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Owen Hunt Has Proven He's Not Dating Material</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Owen-Hunt.jpg><p>Listen, we're as happy as anyone that Owen finally has a baby. However, the man is not exactly a catch. We've seen him cheat on multiple wives, we know he broke off an engagement via email, and he's been keeping Teddy on his string since way back when they were in the Army together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=preston-s-ego-is-too-big-for-an-equal-partnership><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Preston's Ego Is Too Big For An Equal Partnership</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Preston-Burke.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's forget&nbsp;about any BTS drama with Isaiah Washington</a>. We can't fault Preston for walking out on his wedding to Cristina. In fact, it was the best thing that could have happened to her. However, he's still not someone we'd want to date ourselves. Preston needs someone at home raising his babies, who is content to sit back and tell him how amazing he is at the end of each day.</p><h2 id=nathan-is-a-bit-of-a-toss-up><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Nathan Is A Bit Of A Toss Up</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nathan-Riggs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a few episodes there ,Nathan Riggs kind of seemed like the worst dude ever. That being said, we should have known better than to listen to Owen. Riggs did cheat of Megan, but she also cheated on him, so that's their business. He was nice enough to Meredith, though neither of them were all that kind to Maggie. He's not the worst, but certainly not the best.</p><h2 id=richard-has-a-kind-soul-but-his-track-record-isn-t-great><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Richard Has A Kind Soul, But His Track Record Isn't Great</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Richard-Webber.jpg><p>Richard Webber's got a good heart, but he's certainly still flawed. He loved Ellis and should have left Adele for her while she was young enough to move on. However, he let the thought of being with someone more brilliant&nbsp;than him scare him away from true love and then made Adele stick by him for years in a thankless marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=link-s-got-a-lot-going-on-right-now><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Link's Got A Lot Going On Right Now</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Atticus-Lincoln.jpg><p>Maybe in another season or two Link will rank a bit higher. However, this is Grey Sloan we're talking about, so the competition is fierce. Link is indeed a very handsome new addition to the staff, though he's already started flings with many of our main ladies, so he may be a little girl-crazy. Let's let him simmer a bit.</p><h2 id=ben-warren-s-got-the-moves-but-he-s-unpredictable><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ben Warren's Got The Moves, But He's Unpredictable</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ben-Warren-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the most part, Ben Warren has been a pretty&nbsp;good husband to Miranda, who we would imagine is not the easiest woman to be married to. Sure, he's pretty unpredictable and one can never be too sure what type of&nbsp;career he'll be pursuing next week, but he's a decent guy and he makes sure his wife gets extra breadcrumbs on her mac & cheese.</p><h2 id=george-was-desperate-for-love><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>George Was Desperate For Love</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/George-OMalley-1.jpg><p>Back before we lost George, he really was in need of a solid relationship. However, he always went about finding it in the worst ways. Either by marrying Callie when he didn't actually love her, or when he gave all that up thinking his best friend Izzie could be the girl for him. We truly do think that if timing was right, he would have&nbsp;been a caring boyfriend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 TV Shows To Watch If You Like Grey's Anatomy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=deluca-always-gives-his-all><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>DeLuca Always Gives His All</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Andrew-DeLuca-Edited.jpg><p>With the exception of Maggie, we will say that Andrew DeLuca has given a lot of blood, sweat, and tears for the women he's loved. He took that brutal beating by Alex back when he was developing a crush on Jo, his relationship with Sam Bello tore him apart, and we've seen him go above and beyond for Meredith. He might be a little too intense, come to think of it.</p><h2 id=we-could-do-a-lot-worse-than-derek-shepherd><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>We Could Do A Lot Worse Than Derek Shepherd</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-Shepherd.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans like to point out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">flaws in Derek and Meredith's relationship</a>. However, we don't know if that's totally fair. Derek really loved her and their romance was certainly one for the ages. He could let his ego get in the way, but most of them time he came around. We'd be honored to go on a date with Dr. McDreamy.</p><h2 id=alex-is-troubled-but-a-good-man><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alex Is Troubled, But A Good Man</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alex-Karev-Edited.jpg><p>The outrage that followed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Karev's recent exit</a>&nbsp;proves just how beloved he is. Watching him go from the immature jerk he was when the show started, to the dedicated pediatric surgeon and friend we know him as today, has been one of the greatest parts of the entire series.

However, before that plane crash, Mark was EVERYTHING. Sure, he started out as a womanizer, but eventually we learned that all he wanted was a happy relationship and to care for his daughter. Let's not forget that he was also the founder of the Plastics Posse.

Denny was an absolute sweetheart from the second he was wheeled into the hospital. We fell for him before we even knew he was a millionaire, so yeah, he's that good.

However, during those episodes, he did showcase a lot of excellent qualities. He's a vet, so he's naturally a dog lover, he knows what he's looking for, and he's ready for commitment, though he's also willing to go at his partner's desired pace.
