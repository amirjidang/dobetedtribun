The star has been absolutely crushing the game since her debut back in 2006, and while she may have made a risky move transition from country to pop, it is a risk that definitely paid off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering her fame and fortune, it was only fitting for Taylor Swift to surround herself with equally as powerful women, and fellow singer, Lorde was one of them! When it comes to the New Zealand-born singer, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fact not many people know about Lorde</a> is that she was taken under Swift's wing and the rest is history!</p><p>The two singers shared quite a special friendship, so much that Lorde was part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Swift Squad'</a>. Well, when it was reported that Lorde and music producer, Jack Antonoff, were getting a little too close for comfort, Swift distanced herself from the singer, leaving many fans to wonder whether the two still speak or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Does Lorde Take So Much Time Between Album Releases?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on July 21st, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Lorde and Taylor Swift once shared quite a special relationship, so much that Lorde was even rumored to be a member of Taylor's "Squad". Well, despite their closeness, the duo are no longer friends. Lorde's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close relationship</a> with Lena Dunham's ex, Jack Antonoff allegedly caused a rift between Taylor and Lorde, considering Swift and Lena are pals. Well, now that the dust has settled, there is no more bad blood between the two. With four years having passed since Lorde's last album, fans are stoked that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's releasing new music</a>, especially when it comes to her latest single, 'Solar Power'.</p><h2 id=why-taylor-doesn-39-t-speak-to-lorde>Why Taylor Doesn't Speak To Lorde</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift and Lorde were practically two peas in a pod! The dynamic duo got on quite well, considering they both like to live extremely private lives, aren't into the "Hollywood scene" and are oftentimes misunderstood, however, despite their similarities, it appears as if their friendship was not meant to last forever.</p><p>Although they got along great during award shows, dancing together in the audience, Lorde and Taylor are no longer on speaking terms. Lorde has since spoken out about their friendship, or lack thereof, claiming that<strong> being friends with Taylor Swift was like being friends with someone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has very "specific allergies"</a> </strong>in other words, it's a lotta work!</p><p>Things began to get messy between the two back in 2017 when Lorde was working closely with music producer, Jack Antonoff. While this sounds completely fair, it appears as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorde and Jack were more than just colleagues</a>. Antonoff, who was previously married to actress, Lena Dunham, reportedly got very close to Lorde during their time together. Lena spoke out on the rumored affair, claiming that <strong>she believes the two dated after she and Jack split.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lorde Once Had This Criticism About Reddit After Her AMA</a></span></p><p>Well, considering Lena Dunham and Taylor Swift are also besties, it was only a matter of time before Taylor got word of Lorde's sneaky ways, and began to distance herself. While the speculation can be hard to prove, <strong>Lena revealed that Lorde did, in fact, live with her and Jack during their time making the album</strong>. The rumors stuck to the point that Taylor not only sided with fall pal, Lena Dunham but allegedly cut ties with Lorde for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lena isn't even in Swifts' girl squad</a>, the two have a very close dynamic, making it clear as to why Taylor and Lorde no longer speak. While neither Swift nor Lorde has commented on their falling out, fans are certain this particular theory stands true, especially after the topic has been danced around for so long by so many different people involved.</p><h2 id=lorde-39-s-comeback>Lorde's Comeback</h2><p>Well, after a massive hiatus from the spotlight, Lorde has returned, and she is bigger and better than ever before! While she has enjoyed her privacy, especially when it comes to staying off of social media, Lorde was set for a return, and boy did she deliver.</p><p>The singer made her comeback this summer, four years following the release of her second and most recent album Melodrama, which fans claimed wasn't as great as the first, but semantics, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, <strong>Lorde released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her newest single, 'Solar Power'!</a></strong> The song reached the top of the charts, and fans couldn't wait to stream the single. Considering this was the first that Lorde fans had heard from the Kiwi singer in so long, it's only fitting that the tune went on to do so well.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Fans React To Her Pulling ‘Fearless’ Album Out Of The Grammys</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZZSksrS602aqqZ2RoHq1u4ylpquclWKur8XMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./momagers-garage-inside-kris-jenners-luxurious-car-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Kris Jenner's Luxurious Car Collection">&larr;
