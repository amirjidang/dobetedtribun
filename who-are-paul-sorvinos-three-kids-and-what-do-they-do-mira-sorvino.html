The actor was best known for <a href=#>his role in Goodfellas</a>, where he played Paul Cicero, a caporegime for the infamous Lucchese crime family of the early 20th century.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul Sorvino’s death was announced by his publicist Roger Neal, who said that the actor had died of natural causes. One of the first people to eulogize the fallen star was his daughter, Mira, who wrote a moving tribute in a post on her Twitter account. “My father the great Paul Sorvino has passed. My heart is rent asunder - a life of love and joy and wisdom with him is over. He was the most wonderful father. I love him so much. I’m sending you love in the stars Dad as you ascend,” she wrote. Mira is the first of Paul Sorvino’s three children, all of them from the first of his three marriages – to occupational therapist Lorraine Davis.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Paul Sorvino Almost Quit Goodfellas</a></span></p><h2 id=mira-and-michael-sorvino-are-also-actors><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mira And Michael Sorvino Are Also Actors</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of Paul Sorvino’s children have attempted to follow in his acting footsteps. Firstborn Mira and last-born Michael have, however, enjoyed more success in it than their sister, Amanda.</p><p>Michael has notably lent his voice as lead character Tommy Angelo in the famous video game, Mafia. He has also appeared in dozens of movies and TV shows. Mira’s most distinguished works include Norma Jean & Marilyn, The Replacement Killers and Mighty Aphrodite.</p><h2 id=amanda-sorvino-has-also-dabbled-in-the-film-industry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amanda Sorvino Has Also Dabbled In The Film Industry</span></h2><p>Although not remotely as successful as the rest of her family, Amanda Sorvino has also worked a bit in the film industry. At the zenith of her Hollywood career, she wrote a drama film titled The Trouble With Cali, which her father starred in, alongside her two siblings and their cousin, Bill Sorvino.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amanda also wrote a short film called The Wind in the Reeds in 2017, and played a character called Melody in the Greg Travis romantic drama Midlife from 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrity Kids Who Are More Famous Than Their Parents</a></span></p><h2 id=mira-sorvino-is-an-academy-and-golden-globe-award-winner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mira Sorvino Is An Academy And Golden Globe Award Winner</span></h2><p>There is no doubt that despite her father’s storied career, Mira Sorvino is officially the most accomplished artist in her family. Among many other accolades, the actress is the recipient of both an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe Award.</p><p>Both these trophies were for Best Supporting Actress, for her portrayal of the character Linda Ash in the 1995 comedy film Mighty Aphrodite by Woody Allen. Mira has since joined the pantheon of <a href=#>actors who have spoken out against the filmmaker</a>, following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fall from grace</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-sorvino-also-works-as-a-film-producer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Michael Sorvino Also Works As A Film Producer</span></h2><p>As well as his acting work, Michael Sorvino is also an experienced movie producer. His most recent – and perhaps most successful – project in that regard was the comedy-drama film Almost Paris, which he also featured in.</p><p>Almost Paris was helmed by Martin Scorsese’s daughter Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, in what was her feature film directorial debut. Sorvino’s other producing credits include Blur and The Trouble With Cali.</p><h2 id=mira-and-michael-sorvino-worked-together-in-human-trafficking><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mira And Michael Sorvino Worked Together In Human Trafficking</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from The Trouble With Cali, Michael and Mira Sorvino have also appeared together in films like Summer of Sam and Gods and Generals. Their biggest collaboration, however, would be the 2005 miniseries Human Trafficking, which also starred The Hunger Games star, Donald Sutherland.</p><p>Mira portrayed lead character Agent Kate Morozov, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination</a> for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film. Michael appeared in three episodes, in a supporting role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Evans And Other Celebrities Who Get Along Really Well With Their Siblings</a></span></p><h2 id=mira-sorvino-is-married-with-four-kids><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mira Sorvino Is Married With Four Kids</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mira Sorvino followed her father’s footsteps into acting, and ended up surpassing his achievements. Similarly, she also became a family person in the same way he was. While Paul Sorvino got married thrice, though, Mira has been in the same marriage since June 2004.</p><p>The actress’ husband is Christopher Backus. He is also an actor, with credits in Will & Grace, The O.C. and Redline, among others. Together, they have four kids: two sons and two daughters.</p><h2 id=mira-and-amanda-sorvino-are-also-activists><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mira And Amanda Sorvino Are Also Activists</span></h2><p>Many <a href=#>celebrities today also double up as activists</a>, using their voice to champion various causes close to their heart. Mira Sorvino is no different, especially supporting initiatives towards the eradication of human trafficking around the world. In this goal, she has partnered with Amnesty International as well as the United Nations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amanda Sorvino’s activism leans more towards causes around animal rights and social work.</p><h2 id=are-michael-and-amanda-sorvino-married><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Are Michael And Amanda Sorvino Married?</span></h2><p>Mira Sorvino is not the most public person when it comes to her family life, but her social profile means that it has not been very difficult to follow her journey as a wife and a mother. The same cannot be said of her siblings, Amanda and Michael.</p><p>Amanda Sorvino is believed to be married, although the identity of her husband remains unknown. For Michael, even his marital status is unconfirmed, with most publications speculating that he is single.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2Bmec%2BarKVlo6S%2Ft7XNqKpmrJinsqZ5yqKbrGWRo7Fuw8eaq2acn2LBqbHYZpuoZZ2ev6J50qipr6GepHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-albane-valenzuela-explore-the-details-of-the-lpga-family-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Albane Valenzuela?
