He joined Tesla in 1987.&nbsp; To the truth, Tesla has been friends with Def Leppard.</p><p>The band have recently wrapped up another nationwide tour with Def Leppard, a band they have been good friends with for three decades</p><p>So much so that Tesla wrote a song about<strong> Def Leppard</strong>’s late guitarist Steve Clark. In return, Clark’s six-string partner Phil Collen, recently wrote Tesla’s latest single, “Save That Goodness.” When the bands came off the road, Tesla went back into the studio to write and record the follow-up to 2014’s Simplify album, and Collen joined Tesla as a producer.</p><p>The band City Kidd was renamed Tesla during the recording of their first album, 1986’s Mechanical Resonance, on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name, in addition, there was already another band going by that name.</p><p>Nonetheless, the band’s next two studio albums, Mechanical Resonance was produced by Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson. Jeff has been the lead singer since the beginning of the band.

The band’s lyrics also strayed from the themes popular in hard rock, particularly in the 1980s at the beginning of their career.</p><p>In the early days of their career, Tesla toured with David Lee Roth, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, and Poison which resulted in the band being categorized as a glam metal band. The band’s members resented this labeling</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-keith-in-bar-7></span><span>Jeff Keith in Bar 7</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After going into hiatus with Tesla in 1996, lead vocalist Jeff Keith and guitarist Tommy Skeoch wanted to continue playing music on their own, somehow continuing the line of hard rock/blues Tesla brought in</p><p>Nevertheless, the band recruited former Reinkus Tide member from Los Angeles, guitar player Ray Hinkley, and former Flame members bassist Steve Smith and drummer Denis Bostok. One album was released, The World Is a Freak, in 2000 by Sindrome Records.</p><p>They played over 200 shows before deciding on changing the name to Bar 7 in 1999. Another former Tesla member, Frank Hannon, replaced Skeoch briefly after the release of their only album. But after a couple of months of separation, the original members of Tesla worked out their differences and reunited, thus ending Bar 7.</p><p><strong>Full name</strong>: Jeff Lynn Keith</p><p><strong>Labels</strong>: Geffen, and Tesla Electric Company Recordings</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tesla-band-new-album-%e2%80%9dshock-%e2%80%9d-2020></span><span>Tesla Band New Album: ”Shock ”( 2020)</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In an interview, Jeff was asked about the new album, these are the words he said” We will be doing some songs to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the five-man acoustical jam, so we did 5 or 6 songs from the original album. Then we also added some of the songs we did off our new album Shock that we made with Phil Collin from Def Leppard.”</p><p>The release date of the new album( shock): “From what I have heard, I think maybe in February 2020 but things can change.” Nevertheless, his friend Phil Collin has also played a big role in the release of their new album even Jeff made few comments about him</p><p>”Phil helped us with the writing of the new album. Collin also brought in the production experience that he learned from working with Mutt Lange over the years in Def Leppard. Phil is a fun guy to work with and he knows a lot. The band did try a whole new approach with Phil and we had a blast doing the album and the fans are loving it that’s what counts.”</p><p><strong>The Band Upcoming Tour dates with Def Leppard</strong>( most of the tours will happen in the month of July)</p><p>♦ 12 – Halifax Scotiabank Centre – Halifax, NS<br>♦&nbsp; 13 – Avenir Centre – Moncton, NB<br>♣ 15 – Centre Vidéotron – Quebec City, QC<br>♣ 17 – Bell Centre – Montreal, QC<br>◊ 19 – Canadian Tire Centre – Ottawa, ON</p><p>◊&nbsp; 20 – FirstOntario Centre – Hamilton, ON<br>♥&nbsp; 22 – Budweiser Gardens – London, ON<br>♥&nbsp; 25 – Bell MTS Place – Winnipeg, MB<br>♠&nbsp; 27 – SaskTel Centre – Saskatoon, SK<br>♠&nbsp; 29 – Rogers Place – Edmonton, AB<br><strong>⊗ </strong>&nbsp;31 – Scotiabank Saddledome – Calgary, AB</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-keith-charity-work></span>Jeff Keith Charity Work<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He supports nonprofit charities through his yearly Ride for Reason concerts in the Sacramento, California suburb of Roseville.
