In an interview with Q Magazine, Gene Simmons relayed the idea of his show being similar to another show that was very popular at the time.</p><p>"It is very much like The Osbournes, but I believe that people will see us on television and see how I run things and the rules I make, and they'll think, 'Put that guy in charge!'"

He's quoted saying, "Like most artists I am inspired by work I admire. There are certain similarities between some of my work and the work of others. This was simply meant as an homage to artists I respect, and I definitely want to apologize to any Manga fans or fellow Manga artists who feel I went too far.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gene Simmons Had Quite The Response To Fans Thinking Family Jewels Was Fake</a></span></p><p>My inspirations reflect the fact that certain fundamental imagery is common to all Manga. This is the nature of the medium. I am a big fan of Bleach, as well as other Manga titles. And I am certainly sorry if anyone was offended or upset by what they perceive to be the similarity between my work and the work of artists that I admire and who inspire me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following year, the New York Times reported that Radical Comics was "forced to stop production" after the allegations. Since the controversy over his comic series, Simmons has found work writing for the Huffington Post and living a relatively quiet life in Los Angeles.
