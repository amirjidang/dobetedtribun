Her family moved a lot when she was younger, so she grew up in several towns, most notably Leamington Spa and Warwick, England.</p><p>She has four brothers and two sisters – one sister was diagnosed with epilepsy at a very young age, so the family struggled a lot to fund her brain surgeries and therapies. Most of her private information is kept away from the general public, so nothing else is known about her parent’s names, or her educational background.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jacques made her acting debut in 2009, when she had the guest role of Katie Fielding in ITV series “The Bill”.</p><p>That same year she had a recurring role in the BBC drama miniseries “Desperate Romantics”, that showed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and in which she appeared next to Samuel Barnett.

She kept the role of the Princess of Wessex and Northumbria for three seasons, and also had a role in the “Vikings” spin-off series, “Athelstan’s Journal”.</p><p>That same year, she portrayed the recurring role of Tash in the ITV sitcom “The Delivery Man”, but gave-up the role so she could dedicate her time to filming “Vikings”.</p><p>In 2019, she portrayed Amber Saunders in the drama series “London Kills”, in which she appeared next to Hugo Speer and Bailey Patrick, and made a brief appearance in the romantic TV series “Four Weddings and a Funeral”.</p><p>Jacques has recently been announced to appear in the unaired TV series, “The No Hopers”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jacques is a rather private person, so there isn’t much information disclosed about her private life.
