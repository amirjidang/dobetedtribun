Not to mention, the show introduced fans to several breakout stars. Of course, these include the likes of Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley, Ed Westwick, and Chace Crawford. One cannot forget the appearance of <a href=#>Michelle Trachtenberg as Serena’s [Lively] frenemy Georgina</a>.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Leighton Meester's Net Worth Since 'Gossip Girl'</a></span>At the same time, the show featured an impressive supporting cast that includes Jessica Szohr. On the show, the actress played Vanessa Abrams. The character was first introduced during the first season, although Vanessa didn’t really appear much in the later seasons. That said, the actress did make an appearance during the series finale. Since then, Szohr has taken on several other notable roles and projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-szohr-famously-starred-in-this-music-video>Jessica Szohr Famously Starred In This Music Video</h2><p>Back in 2013, Szohr starred Taylor Swift’s music video for her hit song 22. As fans may know, Szohr has been a longtime Swiftie. And so, the actress was than happy to join the video. “Taylor wrote a song and all of her girlfriends . . . we’ve all been through breakups and stuff together,” Szohr told Us Weekly. “So, she asked a few of us to come and have a fun day at the beach.”</p><p>And while there was some work involved, the Gossip Girl star didn’t really mind. “It was great. We were just in Malibu, and we got to eat pizza all day and then dance around and jump on the trampoline,” Szohr recalled. “It was just a fun, free Saturday.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=after-lsquo-gossip-girl-rsquo-jessica-szohr-took-on-several-movie-roles>After ‘Gossip Girl,’ Jessica Szohr Took On Several Movie Roles</h2><p>âââââââ</p><p>At the same time, Szohr kept busy with several film projects. For starters, there’s the Shawn Levy comedy The Internship, which is headlined by Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne, Josh Gad, and Vince Vaughn who co-wrote the film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is 'Gossip Girl' Star Jessica Szohr's Baby Daddy, And How Did They Meet?</a></span></p><p>Soon after, the actress joined the cast of the romantic comedy Brightest Star, the cast of which also includes Christopher Lowell, Allison Janney, and Clark Gregg. Szohr soon followed this up with the horror-thriller House at the End of the Street and crime thriller 10 Cent Pistol. Later on, the actress joined the cast of the Mark Wahlberg comedy Ted 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=later-on-jessica-szohr-returned-to-tv-too>Later On, Jessica Szohr Returned To TV Too</h2><p>âââââââ</p><p>Having started in television, it seems Szohr continues to have a soft spot for episodic work. For starters, she joined the cast of the USA Network medical drama Complications. At first, however, the actress was hesitant to take on the role of nurse Gretchen Polk.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh, a medical show. I don’t know.’ Not that medical shows aren’t great-they are excellent; Grey’s Anatomy and ER were wonderful. But I questioned if I wanted to play a nurse for potentially five or six years.” the actress recalled during an interview with Shock Ya!. “The pilot was wonderful though, so I booked it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nina Dobrev Shares Adorable New Snaps With Jessica Szohr's Newborn Daughter</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complications was canceled after just one season</a>. Nonetheless, Szohr remained busy, starring in the sport drama Kingdom and the Emmy-nominated series Twin Peaks. Szohr had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recurring role in the Emmy-winning dramedy Shameless</a>.</p><p>Later on, the actress joined the cast of Seth MacFarlane’s adventure comedy The Orville. Here, she plays Xelayan Lieutenant Talla Keyali. It was exactly the role that McFarlane approached her about from the beginning.</p><p>“I sat down with Seth maybe around January [of 2018], and he told me what he wanted to do with Talla….,” Szohr told TV Line. “The social issues that he touches on with this show are so amazing and genius, and it’s so fun because we get to play with it, in space.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the show, Szohr got to have a little reunion with former Gossip Girl co-star Meester. “I love that girl so much, and I was super pumped when Seth told me she was coming,” the actress remarked. “That episode actually is one of my favorites of the season.”</p><h2 id=jessica-szohr-has-been-hosting-a-lsquo-gossip-girl-rsquo-podcast>Jessica Szohr Has Been Hosting A ‘Gossip Girl’ Podcast</h2><p>âââââââ</p><p>The Orville may have been keeping Szohr quite busy these days, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have time for other projects, especially when its Gossip Girl-related. Recently, the actress has been hosting the Gossip Girl podcast XOXO.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I'm trying to say, ‘Hey, come with me, listen to some good music. Let's talk about the fashion. Let's talk about why it worked, why we had fun.’ I think we need more of that right now,” Szohr told Teen Vogue of her new podcast. “The irony is it's a Gossip Girl podcast, but I'm not here to gossip about things. We touch on challenges, but it's a place for people to be able to come and listen, laugh, and get lost.”</p><p>Meanwhile, fans can look forward to seeing Szohr in the upcoming film All-Star Weekend that marks Jamie Foxx’s directorial debut. Foxx stars in the movie alongside Gerard Butler, Benicio Del Toro, Robert Downey Jr., Jeremy Piven, and Snoop Dogg.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Happens To 'Family Guy' If Seth McFarlane Leaves Fox?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yjnKyrmZiubr%2FZqJ%2BrZZKasq951KlkraddqLavr8Rmnqiro569brPIq6No</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hilary-duffs-husband-matthew-koma-jokes-about-newborns-paternity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilary Duff's Husband Matthew Koma Jokes About Newborn's Paternity">&larr;
