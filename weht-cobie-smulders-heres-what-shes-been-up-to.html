She was on the show for over two hundred episodes and nine seasons. This popular TV program ended in 2014 and people still talk about its finale. Anyone who liked the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finale</a>&nbsp;should be unfollowed on all social media platforms. It had to be one of the most disappointing finales ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the show has ended, Cobie has branched out from comedic sitcoms by doing dramas, voiceover work, action films, and (of course) a ton of films for Marvel's Cinematic Universe. If Cobie thought How I Met Your Mother fans were intense, they were mellow compared to Avengers fans! Even her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SNL</a> alum husband, Taran Killam, is a huge Avengers fanboy. Before&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers: Infinity War</a> came out, he had to be dying for spoilers and bugging Cobie day and night.</p><p>Until the next phase of Marvel is unleashed, Cobie’s schedule is jam-packed. She has been adding a variety of television and film roles to her resume.</p><h2 id=a-series-of-unfortunate-events><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>A Series Of Unfortunate Events</span></h2><p>Cobie Smulders played the mother in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a>. SPOILER: she wasn’t the mother we were hoping for. She played the mother of a group of random children, instead of the mother of the Baudelaire children. This made a very depressing show even more depressing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Only The Most Unfortunate Fans Noticed In 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events'</a></span></p><h2 id=literally-right-before-aaron><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Literally, Right Before Aaron</span></h2><p>Cobie starred alongside Lea Thomson and Justin Long in this comedic drama. Cobie played Allison, who invited her college boyfriend, Adam (Justin Long), to attend her wedding. The premise brings up one giant question. Why? Why would anyone invite an ex to a wedding...let alone a recent one?</p><h2 id=killing-gunther><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Killing Gunther</span></h2><p>Killing Gunther was an action-comedy made in 2017. It’s about a group of assassins who are very annoyed with the world’s greatest hitman, so they team up together to kill him. The film was directed and written by Cobie’s husband, Taran Killam. He also stars alongside his wife in the film.</p><h2 id=present-laughter><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Present Laughter</span></h2><p>When How I Met Your Mother&nbsp;wrapped, Cobie branched out from comedy by focusing on action films and dramas. Anything different than the sitcom she spent years working on appealed to her. Present Laughter pushed her further out of her comfort zone - it was about an actor who was having a midlife crisis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nature-cat><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Nature Cat</span></h2><p>The Avengers star was in four episodes of Nature Cat, playing the character, 'Nature Dog'. It’s clear that not a lot of thought is put into character names on kid’s shows! While we haven’t watched this show, it seems obvious from the title that it’s about a cat and friends. They go on adventures to learn about nature.</p><h2 id=avengers-infinity-war><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Avengers: Infinity War</span></h2><p>Once cast in one Marvel movie, the actor automatically signs up for ten more movies. Cobie plays Maria Hill, a shield agent, and Nick Fury’s right-hand girl. As awesome as she is, she probably has ten lines in all the MCU movies she’s been in. Personally, we’d like a Maria Hill spin-off film more than a Black Widow one.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disneyland Announces New Avengers' Campus Amidst Corona Pandemic</a></span></p><h2 id=alright-now><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Alright Now</span></h2><p>Alright Now, formerly known as Songbird, is about a rock musician who goes back to college after her band falls apart and she breaks up with her boyfriend. It must have been an awful breakup to make her give up on her dream. Cobie plays the lead character, Joanne. Joanne definitely isn’t a rock n’ roll name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-from-college><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Friends From College</span></h2><p>Friends from College was Cobie’s first major television show she signed on for after&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother ended. Previously, she had agreed to do guest spots. With Friends from College, she was in two seasons - then, the show was canceled by Netflix. She got to act with Keegan-Michael Key, Fred Savage, and Billy Eichner, which had to be a blast.</p><h2 id=the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</span></h2><p>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part was her third time working with Will Arnett and Chris Pratt. She played another superhero - this time, in the DC Universe. She voiced Wonder Woman, who also made an appearance in the first Lego film. This was her second Lego character she’s done voiceover work for. She's the voice of Maria Hill in Lego Marvel’s Avengers, which is a video game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arrested-development><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Arrested Development</span></h2><p>In 2019, Cobie did several episodes of Arrested Development, playing Young Lucille, the younger version of Jessica Walter’s character. During her three episodes, she worked with her husband, Taran Killam, who played young George Bluth Sr., the younger version of Jeffrey Tambor’s character. Being given the opportunity to be on a hit TV show is amazing, but getting to do it with your partner, is dream-worthy.</p><h2 id=avengers-endgame><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></h2><p>Maria Hill made it back from Thanos to join the Avengers in Avengers: End Game. Maybe she’ll get to join the Avengers on Disney’s new Avengers’ Campus, which is opening this summer. If not, she could be a special meet-and-greet during an Avengers-themed night party at the park.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ALL The Best Easter Eggs Hidden In The Avengers Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=spider-man-far-from-home><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Spider-Man: Far From Home</span></h2><p>Maria Hill was alongside Nick Fury as they tried to corral the youngest and newest leader of the Avengers, Spiderman. Clearly, based on this still, it was not going well. They are trying to save the world from aliens, and they are depending on a teenager who wants to leave to meet up with a girl he likes. Samuel L. Jackson would’ve had some choice words about the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man 3: Tom Holland Says MCU Sequel Story Will Include Zendaya</a></span></p><h2 id=room-104><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Room 104</span></h2><p>Cobie was featured in the season three finale of Room 104. She played Dr. Marian Wallace, who stays in Room 104 after an expedition. During her stay, weird plants begin to grow from the room - as a botanist, she wants to protect and study the plants. Unfortunately, the government has different plans for them.</p><h2 id=stumptown><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Stumptown</span></h2><p>Stumptown is based on the popular comic book. Cobie plays the lead character, Dex Parios, who is a bisexual veteran. Dex becomes a private investigator in Portland, where she takes care of her brother and tries to cope with her PTSD. Jake Johnson from New Girl also stars in the show. We really hope it gets a second season on ABC.</p><h2 id=cicada><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cicada</span></h2><p>Cicada is Cobie’s latest project, which has yet to be given a release date. The film was written and directed by Matthew Fifer, who Cobie has worked with on Avengers. Matthew Fifer plays the lead role, Ben, who is in a relationship with a man during the time of the Sandusky trial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Behind-The-Scenes Secrets From How I Met Your Mother</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunqCkYrCwrsieZKylpaGxpr7SZp%2BeqpWoeri0wK1krKCVqHqjscSnZK6oXam8cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./which-songs-did-john-mayer-and-taylor-swift-write-about-each-other.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Songs Did John Mayer And Taylor Swift Write About Each Other?">&larr;
