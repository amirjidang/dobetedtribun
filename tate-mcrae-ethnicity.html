He once said she was his crush in an interview, and later, they made it official on Instagram with a vacation photo. Cole plays for the Columbus Blue Jackets in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">National Hockey League</a>.</span></p><p><span>Tate talked about Cole in an interview in August 2022. She shared that he’s a friend of her brother’s, and they started talking after he admitted she was his crush.

Also, Tate’s music video for “Greedy” was filmed in a hockey arena, adding to the breakup rumors.</span></p><p><span>Tate mentioned how proud she was of the “Greedy” video in 2023. She got to dance and create something she loved, a feeling she didn’t have before.</span></p><p><span>Just so you know, Tate is a Canadian singer who started with “One Day” in 2017. But it was her 2023 song “Greedy” that made her super famous, especially after it went viral on TikTok and reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.</span></p><p><span>“When I look at my favorite icons or videos or performances, it’s always the biggest pop stars, so I think that’s always a goal. I think what defines a pop star is how iconic [they are]: Madonna, Britney [Spears], Christina [Aguilera]; they would put on these shows and blow everybody away and make timeless art. And that’s what I want to do: make timeless art and timeless performances — and strive to keep on doing that.”</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Xochitl Gomez Ethnicity: Unveiling the Enchanting Ethnic Mosaic of the Talented Young Actress!!</strong></a></p><h2><span>Tracing the Inspiring Journey, Milestones, and Unstoppable Ascendancy in the Dazzling Career of Tate Mcrae!!</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tate-album-featured-scaled.webp alt="tate mcrae ethnicity" width=2560 height=1706 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>Tate McRae started dancing when she was just 4, learning from her mom.
