The role in the series&nbsp;was her first big hit in the industry as she featured in 21 episodes. Since then, the actress has appeared in other television series, movies and television films, portraying each character she plays perfectly.</p><p>She has also appeared in a number of music videos as well as the video game version of the series,&nbsp;Desperate Housewives. Chloe has also appeared in&nbsp;commercials for Adelphia and&nbsp;AT&T.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chloe-bridges-bio-age-ethnicity></span><strong>Chloe Bridges Bio (Age, Ethnicity)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chloe Suazo, known professionally as&nbsp;Chloe Bridges, was born&nbsp;in Thibodaux, Louisiana, US,&nbsp;on&nbsp;December 27, 1991. Although the name of her parents is not known, it is clear that her father is from the&nbsp;Republic of Honduras while her mother is English. Consequently, Chloe, who is an American national, also&nbsp;half Latina and half White.</p><p>Chloe attended&nbsp;John Muir Middle School in Burbank, Southern California. According to her, she was a nerd in school and even won&nbsp;the “Student of the Month Award” one time in early 2005, despite the fact that she went for movie auditions regularly. Speaking in an interview with&nbsp;Just Jared, the actress said she was not popular in high school and was probably known by just about sixty people who were members of the same show choir she was a part of.</p><p>After high school, Chloe&nbsp;enrolled in Columbia University’s School of General Studies in 2014. At the time, she was starring in the&nbsp;teen drama&nbsp;mystery-thriller&nbsp;television series,&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars.</p><p>Chloe Bridges began acting professionally in 2005 with the role of&nbsp;Zoey Moreno in the&nbsp;ABC&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;<i>Freddie.&nbsp;</i>For the role which she played until 2006, the talented actress&nbsp;was credited under her birth name, Chloe Suazo.&nbsp;The series was built around the real-life happenings and experiences of Freddie Prinze Jr. (played by Freddie Moreno) as he grew up in a house full of women.&nbsp;In 2006, Chloe&nbsp;guest-starred as the <i>Freddie&nbsp;</i>character, Zoey Moreno,&nbsp;in an episode of the TV series,&nbsp;<i>George Lopez.</i></p><p>She appeared in the 2009 films&nbsp;<i>Legally Blondes</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Forget Me Not&nbsp;</i>and later she was cast as&nbsp;Dana Turner in the sequel,&nbsp;<i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam </i>(2010). The following year, Chloe appeared in the television film,&nbsp;Worst. Prom. Ever. and also in the television series,&nbsp;90210 and&nbsp;Suburgatory.&nbsp;She followed it up in 2012 by appearing as&nbsp;Donna LaDonna in&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City</i>&nbsp;prequel,&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<i>The Carrie Diaries. </i>The series which was aired on The CW&nbsp;TV Network ran from&nbsp;2013 to 2014 over two seasons. Also in 2012, the star actress appeared in one episode of the&nbsp;Fox&nbsp;television series,&nbsp;<i>New Girl.</i></p><p>Chloe played the role of Kat in the 2013 comedy-drama&nbsp;movie,&nbsp;Family Weekend&nbsp;and in the same year, she had a main role in the&nbsp;comedy-drama&nbsp;television series,&nbsp;The Carrie Diaries (2013–2014). She also featured in the TV film Social Nightmare.</p><p>The young lady played a major character in the&nbsp;2014 film, Mantervention.&nbsp;In April of the same year, she grabbed a&nbsp;recurring role in season five of the teen drama series,&nbsp;<i>Pretty Little Liars</i>&nbsp;as&nbsp;Sydney Driscoll. She was in the show until when it ended in 2017.</p><p>Chloe Bridges has remained very active in the industry since she came on board and has appeared in many other films and television series, including&nbsp;<i></i><i>Nightlight </i><i>Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates </i>(2016),&nbsp;<i>Little Bitches </i>(2018),&nbsp;<i>Game Over, Man!&nbsp;</i>(2018),&nbsp;Faking It&nbsp;(2015–2016), Daytime Divas (2017) and&nbsp;Insatiable&nbsp;(2018).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-she-and-adam-devine-meet></span><strong>How Did She and Adam DeVine Meet?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chloe Bridges is in a relationship with Adam DeVine, an&nbsp;actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer, and singer known for the&nbsp;Comedy Central&nbsp;series&nbsp;<i>Workaholics </i>and also for the TV series,&nbsp;<i>Adam DeVine’s House Party.</i></p><p>The couple&nbsp;began their romance just the same way many other Hollywood couples started. Yes…they met on set.&nbsp;A report on&nbsp;Us Weekly revealed that they met during the making of the horror movie,&nbsp;The Final Girls,&nbsp;in which both of them played supporting roles&nbsp;and they’ve been together ever since.</p><p>Although the actors kept things very&nbsp;low key when they started dating as most celebrities usually do, news of their relationship eventually filtered out in February 2015 and now, they don’t mind showing&nbsp;their love for each other even in public.</p><p>They have been at&nbsp;premieres of each other’s movies,&nbsp;walking the red carpet hand-in-hand. They also took a trip to Disneyland&nbsp;together in 2015 and were spotted&nbsp;attending a Sam Smith’s concert with friends. Sometime in 2017, the duo was seen sitting courtside at a Los Angeles Clippers game, unashamed to show some PDA (public display of affection).</p><p>In December 2018, they attended the game&nbsp;between the Los Angeles Clippers and Sacramento Kings at Staples Center and were all smiles watching the matchup. From the couple’s countenance in all these outings, there is no doubt that they are very much in love, probably the reason why their relationship is still waxing strong.</p><p>Despite being in love, Chole and DeVine still have their couple’s fight once in a while. However, speaking to&nbsp;People&nbsp;magazine, DeVine said he has a sure-fire way of wriggling himself out of her doghouse. According to him, his&nbsp;aggressive smooch-attack usually gets him out of most troubles.</p><p>Considering the length of time they have been together, it is believed that&nbsp;Chloe Bridges and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pitch Perfect&nbsp;actor have dated long enough for DeVine to pop the question. This became a public topic for discussion after the couple made a trip to&nbsp;Venice, Paris and lodged&nbsp;in a honeymoon suite.</p><p>Adam disclosed afterwards while speaking with&nbsp;Hit 105’s Stav, Abby and Matt with Osher Gunsberg, that he believed Chloe must have been expecting him to propose during the getaway&nbsp;in August 2017,&nbsp;but he was “too dumb to have picked any clues.” He, however, made it clear that he will do the needful when the time is right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYobymecGroJ2flah6o7XOZpignV2awam6yJygrbFdnby4ecOim2armJp6orrDZpidmZ1isabCyKecZqWVmsFw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christina-aguileras-wild-vma-looks-2012158.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Aguilera's Wild VMA Looks">&larr;
