However, reports and numerous celebrity interviews suggest that not all know how to go, and not all possess a driver's license. For example, Cardi B admitted that she <a href=# rel=nofollow>has five fancy luxury cars </a>and only bought them to flaunt them on her social media accounts since she cannot drive. It seems ridiculous, but this seems ordinary for people who have so much money and wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The list below is some of the celebrities who admitted that they do not know how to drive and do not have a driver's license. Yet, these celebrities can afford to have someone drive them around, and a driver's license seems to be the least of their problems.

Although she has a decent collection of cars, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>All I Want For Christmas Is You</a><a href=# rel=nofollow> singer</a> does not plan to drive those cars.

As soon as he got famous and earned his wealth, he immediately bought fancy cars, including a Ferrari, a Mercedes, a Porsche and an Aston Martin. However, it seems like driving them is not on his priority list since he still does not have a driver's license even to this day. In 2020, Williams attempted to drive a golf cart and failed miserably by crashing the cart. "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I never had driving lessons</a>, I never passed the test," Williams defended in a video taken by his wife Ayda Field. She responded by telling Williams he was no longer allowed to drive golf carts.</p><h2 id=j-k-rowling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>J. K.

K. Rowling does not have a driver's license. She has joked about not having a license in interviews and on social media, and some fans even teased that she would rather be flying a broom like the characters in her iconic young adult series. The writer blames her lack of spacial awareness and difficulty with machinery for the choice of not taking the driver's test. Rowling has previously taken driving lessons, but decided it was in everyone's best interest if she stayed off the road.</p><h2 id=cardi-b><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cardi B</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Quirky rapper Cardi B</a> has an impressive luxury car collection; however, she cannot take them for a spin since she does not have a driver's license. She is well known for flaunting her impressive fleet of cars through her Instagram account, where she has posted a Fiat 124 Spider, a customized Rolls-Royce, numerous Lamborghini, and a lot more. It is acceptable for her not to drive those as she has a driver to take her around. However, in her interview with James Corden, she has admitted that she plans to take some driving lessons and plans to get her driver's license soon.</p><h2 id=tana-mongeau><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tana Mongeau</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tana-mongeau-(1).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tana Mongeau is a very controversial YouTuber. She has had a lot of scandals during her time in the public eye, but her diehard fans are still consistent with keeping her videos popular and relevant. Despite the internet fame, Mongeau never got around to getting a driver's license. She never even received a driving permit. The YouTuber has admitted to only being behind the wheel a handful of times and having no idea how to drive.

She has confessed that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">she really does not have a driver's license</a>, although it is not clear why she does not plan on getting one. Technically, it is realistic not to drive around since she is living in New York City where driving can be a little hassle. She would much rather get around by other means and avoid getting stuck in traffic. In addition, she can just pay someone to drive her around since she can afford to anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Much Of Adam Sandler's Insane Net Worth Has Gone To Luxury Cars And Over The Top Real Estate?</a></span></p><h2 id=vincent-kartheiser><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Vincent Kartheiser</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/alexis-bledel-and-vincent-kartheiser-1510937317.jpg><p>Vincdent Kartheiser was one of the stars of the hit show Mad Men, and was previously married to Gilmore Girls star Alexis Bledel for eight years before they separated in 2022. It is surprising that for someone who lives in Los Angeles they choose not to drive. While the actor admits that part of the choice is due to nerves about being behind the wheel, Kartheiser mostly chooses not to drive because of the environment. The Mad Men actor takes public transportation everywhere he goes in order to do his part in decreasing pollution.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lena-dunham><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lena Dunham</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lena-dunham-snooping.jpg><p>American writer, director, <a href=# rel=nofollow>actress, and producer Lena Dunham</a> is among the celebrities who haven't gotten their driver's license yet. Some people just don't feel like getting their driver's license and some even think that there's really no point in getting one. That seems to be the case for Dunham as she has tweeted before admitting that she cannot drive, and it's gotten to the point from being cute to pathetic and tragic. At least the actress has the self-awareness that she is not the kind of person to be behind a wheel. She has accepted that she will be stranded for life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barbra-streisand><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Barbra Streisand</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar47724939.jpg><p>Barbra Streisand fell victim to the renewal process of having a driver's license. Though she has been driving all her life and renewing her license, she suddenly had to re-take the written and driving portions of the license test. The famous singer actually failed the driving test three times during the process. When she appeared on James Cordon's Carpool Karaoke, she told the story and even had some driving mishaps while filming the sing-along. Though talented in many ways, driving is certainly not one of her strong suits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LEqbuMnaanrF2drrexjJpknaqZq7Kzv4yloJydnqiycA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./top-10-richest-american-sports-team-owners.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 Richest Sports Team Owners in America">&larr;
