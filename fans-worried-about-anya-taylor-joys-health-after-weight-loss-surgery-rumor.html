When somebody reaches that kind of stature, they inevitably get the superstar treatment, which includes having their photo taken endlessly. After comparing photos of Taylor-Joy over time, many fans concluded that <strong>the actor may have undergone plastic surgery</strong>. Specifically, many observers believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor-Joy has gotten buccal fat removal surgery</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/are-anya-taylor-joy-s-buccal-fat-removal-and-plastic-surgery-rumors-based-in-any-truth_.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When and where was Anya Taylor-Joy born</a>, according to Britannica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Anya Taylor-Joy born?:</p></td><td><p>April 16, 1996</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Anya Taylor-Joy born?:</p></td><td><p>Miami, Florida</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old is Anya Taylor-Joy as of March 2024?:</p></td><td><p>27 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Over the last several years, it has seemed like buccal fat removal surgery has become very popular among celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Johns Hopkins Medicine's website, undergoing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the procedure changes how a person's cheeks look</a>.

The size and shape of these pads varies from person to person. More fat in the buccal region can give the face a round appearance."</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johns Hopkins Medicine continues, "Removing buccal fat can make the cheekbones more defined and by creating a shadow contrast between the cheekbones and the lower jaw while making the face look less round and more V-shaped."</p><p>While fans have worried about Anya Taylor-Joy's changing face, some in the fashion business clearly feel differently. After all, in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor-Joy won the Face of the Year award</a> at the CFDA Fashion Awards.</p><p>Comparing newer and older photos of Taylor-Joy, there is no doubt that <strong>the actor's cheeks look very different</strong>.

That photo showed the world <strong>how incredibly thin Taylor-Joy's waist looked</strong> while wearing the old-fashioned garment, much to the shock of many.</p><p>To say that the corset photo got a big response is a huge understatement. In many cases, the responding fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed a great deal of concern for the actor's health</a>. One example of that is the fact that one social media user expressed concern about <strong>how the corset affected Taylor-Joy's body</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Are your ribs okay?

A writer who is focused on parenting books, Carey cited her years of extensive research.</p><p>"In reality the image is incredibly dangerous – especially to impressionable young girls.

As Carey's piece explains, she worries that the biggest danger of the corset photo is it could inspire some people to go to extremely dangerous lengths to lose weight.</p><p>Just like Carey, several social media users expressed their worries about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the example Taylor-Joy's corset photo set for impressionable young women</a>. One perfect example of that is the fact that one woman wrote, “Can we not normalize starvation?” on social media.</p><p>Another social media user expressed their opinion that Taylor-Joy's corset photo is damaging to society. “Do you realize how corsets are hurtful for women’s health and should not be promoted?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsSwvtGinJ1lkZe8tsCMmqWymV2prrq4zqtko6epqHqpscClq6FlkZvBpr6MsJyin5ipeq270qxkrK2inLKzxYyrrKanomQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./franz-buerstedde-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-271804-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Franz Buerstedde Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
