If a topic is too controversial, his team might shut off comments completely. However, that wasn't the case for his interview with President Joe Biden, and fans felt like that was a major mistake. The general reception looking back was that Biden was underprepared, and that Kimmel saved the President multiple times during the interview two years ago.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look back at the conversation, and what fans had to say. It wasn't as bad as the recent debate, but in the eyes of many, very underwhelming.</p><p>We're going to reveal what was discussed, and other interviews Kimmel's team shut comments off for. We will also touch on Kimmel's history with <strong><a href=#>Donald Trump</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-27t071555-359.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jimmy Kimmel's Face Changed Color After Dakota Johnson Predicted What Pictures The Host Has In His Phone ">Jimmy Kimmel's Face Changed Color After Dakota Johnson Predicted What Pictures The Host Has In His Phone</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jimmy Kimmel looked guilty when Dakota Johnson teased him about the scandalous contents of his phone.</p><h2 id=joe-biden-39-s-interview-with-jimmy-kimmel-resembled-his-recent-presidential-debate-and-fans-let-him-have-it>Joe Biden's Interview With Jimmy Kimmel Resembled His Recent Presidential Debate, And Fans Let Him Have It</h2><p>Back in 2022, it was a special episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, with President Joe Biden as the guest. Heading into the conversation,<strong> Biden was already receiving heat for his lack of appearances on talk shows during his run as President</strong>, which was unlike past Presidents such as Barack Obama, and even Donald Trump.</p><p>Of course, the conversation was politically motivated, and touched on several different issues in the US at the time. A couple of years later, most are still worth discussing.</p><p>A summary of Biden and Kimmel's interview:</p><ul><li>School shooting in America,</li><li>Passing an Executive Order.</li><li>Strides in climate change.</li><li>Joe Manchin & Kyrsten Sinema,</li><li>Rising food and gas prices.</li><li>Negative impact of the pandemic.</li><li>Mental Health Care.</li><li>Changes in the press.</li><li>Hope for the US.</li></ul><p>The lengthy interview certainly was diverse. However, the outcome was not a positive one. <strong>Generally, fans felt as though the President was all over the place throughout the interview</strong>. In addition, the majority of viewers could not believe that Kimmel's YouTube team left comments open. <strong>A near 48K wrote in, and the most liked comments were anything but positive.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>What were the most liked comments saying?</strong></p><ul><li>"Heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the BS."</li><li>"Props for having the guts to leave the comments section enabled. I knew right away it was gonna be wild lol."</li><li>"I started watching this interview as a Democrat. I’m now a Republican. Thanks, Jimmy."</li><li>"Can’t describe how glad I am that I looked in the comments and everyone was thinking the same thing.

Kimmel looked extra bubbly throughout the interview as the adult star detailed her time with Donald Trump. “I’m pretty sure I thought he was channeling Hugh Hefner,” said Daniels upon entering Trump's hotel room. "Significantly less sexy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike her first time on the show, Daniels was very open this time around. She discussed what Trump was watching in his hotel room (Shark week), along with the items that could be found in the former President's bathroom.</p><p>Jimmy Kimmel was having a blast throughout the chat. However, the fan reaction was limited as <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel's YouTube team wisely turned off the comments</a>. In all likelihood, that was done to protect Stormy Daniels from the backlash. Let's face it, Stormy appearing on the show alone took a lot of courage, especially knowing how controversial it was going to be.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-03t140014-909.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jimmy Kimmel Couldn't Keep A Straight Face After Stormy Daniels Revealed What She Found In Donald Trump's Bathroom">Jimmy Kimmel Couldn't Keep A Straight Face After Stormy Daniels Revealed What She Found In Donald Trump's Bathroom</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Stormy Daniels went into detail during her interview with Jimmy Kimmel, revealing everything she found in Donald Trump's bathroom.</p><p>With the election looming closer and closer, it'll be interesting to see how Jimmy Kimmel might alter his choice of guests in the upcoming months.

Kimmels admits ABC warned him about the Trump content, especially during Donald's run as President. Still, Kimmel wouldn't oblige, and was willing to step down if that was going to be the plan of action.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-30t170538-090.png><ul><li>“There was at one time, maybe, I don’t know, right around the beginning of this whole Trump thing where … that was kind of hinted at, but I just said, ‘Listen, I get it.

So if you want somebody else to host the show, then that’s fine. That’s OK with me. I’m just not going to do it like that’ … I have lost half of my fans — maybe more than that."</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kimmel went on to admit that he was at one point the most popular late night host among Republicans.</p><p>“Ten years ago, among Republicans, I was the most popular talk show host, at least according to the research that they did.”</p><p>It'll certainly make for some interesting months of television.
