Among her fans are plenty of celebs who love posting pics of their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">encounters with Billie on social media</a>. However, occasionally, there&nbsp;are those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who have bad things to say</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, we thought we'd take a look at some of Billie's famous friends, as the star has quickly assembled quite a few of those. From Ariana Grande to Justin Bieber, anyone who's someone in the world of the rich and famous wants to be in Billie's inner circle. While we don't know how long these friendships will last — after all celebs love beefing with each other — it seems as if Billie is on the right path...everyone is absolutely loving her!</p><p>Alright, now here they are — 11 celebs who are actually friends with Billie Eilish!</p><h2 id=let-s-start-off-with-billie-eilish-and-her-friend-lana-del-rey><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Let's Start Off With Billie Eilish And Her Friend, Lana Del Rey</span></h2><p>To kick our list off, we decided to go with Lana Del Rey. Billie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whose rise to fame was incredibly quick</a>, has undeniably been influenced by Lana, and fans were quick to notice that in Billie's music.</p><p>Lana is a huge fan of the young singer and, in an interview published in The New York Times, the singer stated that she loves Billie Eilish. Lana said she had been waiting for someone like Billie to come along and elevate pop music culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Above, you can see the two musicians hanging out — and Billie's brother, Finneas, was also present!</p><h2 id=it-s-no-secret-that-billie-is-a-huge-fan-of-justin-bieber-and-now-they-get-to-hang-out><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>It's No Secret That Billie Is A Huge Fan Of Justin Bieber — And Now They Get To Hang Out</span></h2><p>Next on our list is singer, Justin Bieber - true Billie fans probably already know that Billie was a huge Belieber while growing up. Nowadays, the singer gets to hang out with Justin and she even gets professional advice from the star.</p><p>In an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Justin even got super-emotional over Billie. He said that he feels very protective of her. We can't wait to see how their friendship evolves — and we certainly want more collabs from them!</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-doesn-t-hide-her-love-for-billie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ariana Grande Doesn't Hide Her Love For Billie</span></h2><p>Let's move onto another friend of Billie's — singer, Ariana Grande. We all know that Billie is a huge fan of Ariana. Billie even stated that she thought Ari's Thank U, Next record deserved the Grammy for Album of the Year — but Ariana definitely thinks that Billie deserved her win in that category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Above, you can see the two ladies with each other, and honestly, seeing two successful women support each other, instead of bringing each other down, definitely warms our hearts!</p><h2 id=and-post-malone-is-yet-another-one-of-her-famous-buddies><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>And Post Malone Is Yet Another One Of Her Famous Buddies</span></h2><p>Another famous face that made it onto our list is Post Malone. In the photos above, you can see him hanging out with Billie and honestly — we can totally tell that the two always have a blast with each other. It certainly seems as if Billie managed to make plenty of friends in the industry very quickly, which frankly isn't that common.</p><p>As we already mentioned, competing against each other for the highest position on the charts frequently turns celebs against each other!</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-and-her-daughter-absolutely-love-billie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez And Her Daughter Absolutely Love Billie</span></h2><p>Next on our list is singer Jennifer Lopez, who is yet another famous fan of Billie Eilish. As you can tell from the photos above, Jennifer's daughter, Emme, is also a fan of Billie. Because Emme's mom is a superstar, Emme got to hang out with Eilish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer posted the pics on her social media and it's certainly clear that she has nothing but love for Billie. Eilish could certainly learn a lot from J-Lo — after all, she's been a successful musician for almost three decades!</p><h2 id=billie-collaborated-with-her-friend-khalid><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Billie Collaborated With Her Friend Khalid</span></h2><p>Singer, Khalid, is yet another celeb that is close to Billie. As fans already know, the two young stars collaborated on the song, "Lovely", and, as they are both fairly new to the music industry, they certainly bonded very quickly.</p><p>Personally, we love hearing their voices together and we certainly hope that the future holds plenty more collaborations for the two of them. When he was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Khalid said that the moment he heard Billie's voice, he knew she was going to be a star!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-here-s-the-young-star-with-avril-lavigne><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>And Here's The Young Star With Avril Lavigne</span></h2><p>Avril Lavigne is yet another famous face who's been spotted with Billie Eilish, and as you can tell from the pics above, the two musicians certainly have a good time together. According to E! News, Billie, who used to look up to Avril, is so close to the singer now that Avril even attended Billie's super-chill 18th birthday party — and you don't invite just anyone to your birthday!</p><p>Just like some other stars on our list, Avril will certainly be one of those friends Billie can ask for advice whenever she needs it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish Has Her First-Ever Prom With John Krasinski!</a></span></p><h2 id=noah-cyrus-and-billie-eilish-definitely-have-a-lot-in-common><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Noah Cyrus And Billie Eilish Definitely Have A Lot In Common</span></h2><p>Next on our list is Miley Cyrus' younger sister, Noah. Noah, who is only two years older than Billie, certainly has a lot in common with the singer — but most of all, Noah is a huge fan of Billie.</p><p>Noah revealed to Billboard that Billie's "Everything I Wanted" has made it to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her favorites playlist</a>, as the song (which is about mental health) really resonates with the star. Yes, this is definitely another duo that we would love to see collaborate, as both ladies have a very unique singing style!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish Monopolizes On Her Fame With A New Music Show, And Shes Keeping It In The Family!</a></span></p><h2 id=and-charlie-xcx-likes-hanging-out-with-the-singer-as-well><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And Charlie XCX Likes Hanging Out With The Singer As Well</span></h2><p>Another one of Billie's famous friends is Charlie XCX. Out of all the celebs on our list, Charlie is the one that has probably given the boldest statement about the young singer. She said that Billie is the Kurt Cobain of this new generation. Honestly, we can't really disagree with Charlie!</p><p>Here, you can see her hanging out with Billie at a photoshoot - both ladies looked incredibly cool. Seeing so many celebs supporting each other definitely warms our little hearts!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish Gets A Restraining Order In Place Against A Crazed Fan… He Wasn’t Socially Distancing!</a></span></p><h2 id=here-are-katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-catching-up-with-billie><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Here Are Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom&nbsp;Catching Up With Billie</span></h2><p>Let's move on to singer, Katy Perry, and her fiance, Hollywood star, Orlando Bloom. As you can see, they hung out with Billie at Coachella last year, and after that, Katy posted these pics to her social media, with the caption, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we must protect Billie Eilish</a>, beings like her don’t enter our orbit often".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, we completely agree with Katy, because Billie certainly is a treasure — and we're pretty sure that her music will stick around for decades!</p><h2 id=and-lastly-here-s-the-singer-running-into-her-friend-dua-lipa-at-the-american-music-awards><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Lastly, Here's The Singer Running Into Her Friend Dua Lipa At The American Music Awards</span></h2><p>To wrap our list up, we decided to go with Dua Lipa. In the photos above, you can see the two ladies posing at the 2019 American Music Awards. Once again — we're super-happy to see that none of these new female artists look at each other as competition. Instead. they support and cheer each other on! And there you have it - Billie Eilish has plenty of famous friends and she certainly deserves every single one of them.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts Few People Know About Billie Eilish Before She Became Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBursilo6KdXZq2rbXSoWScpJ%2Bosm60xKtknJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-priyanka-chopra-jonas-sister-parineeti-chopra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Priyanka Chopra Jonas' Sister Parineeti Chopra?">&larr;
