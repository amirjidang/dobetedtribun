While Jenelle had legally separated from David in February, she is not eligible to officially file for divorce until they have been apart for a full year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the scheduled court session, the pair was expected to discuss a range of topics including the custody arrangements for their daughter, Ensley, the terms of child support, and how to divide their shared assets. This division of property likely includes deciding who will retain ownership of their property and other shared assets, including their boat.</p><p>However, the hearing did not proceed as planned. At the judge’s request, the case has been postponed and will now be revisited later this summer.</p><h2 id=david-rsquo-s-new-girlfriend-looks-like-jenelle>David’s New Girlfriend Looks Like Jenelle</h2><p>Meanwhile, Jenelle has been busy moving on. She has been romantically involved with August Keen, her manager as well as new romantic partner. Jenelle has openly talked about August on her show, Teen Mom: Next Chapter, and has even relocated to Las Vegas to be near him, suggesting a serious commitment to this new relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, David has also been making headlines with his new love interest, a woman named Kenleigh. David, who has reportedly been living on a couple’s dilapidated boat, has shared several videos on social media showcasing his time at Kenleigh’s house.</p><p>Kenleigh, who is 25 years old (a full decade younger than David)and works in photography and graphic design, has been seen on social media flaunting her home in North Carolina.</p><p>Although Jenelle has not made any public statements about David's new relationship, many fans and observers have noted that Kenleigh bears a striking resemblance to Jenelle, sparking discussions among followers about the similarities between the two women.</p><p>As both David and Jenelle move forward with their separate lives, it’s clear that their personal dramas continue to captivate the public's attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David Eason's past is marred by a series of legal issues. Before his relationship with Jenelle, he had faced multiple arrests for offenses including drug possession and assault. His criminal history is a significant aspect of his public persona. David's controversial actions included a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2018 incident where he killed the family dog, Nugget,</a> which led to a temporary loss of Jenelle’s children and widespread condemnation.</p><p>Despite this, David and Kenleigh's relationship appears to be a fresh start for him, offering a glimpse into his post-Jenelle life. Fans may even get to hear Jenelle’s perspective on things now that she’s returned to the Teen Mom franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnp2eYrqwuYysq5qqXZmut7XDZpyaq5%2Bjeq%2Bx1maeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMo5ynnZyhsm6x1ZqlrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./teezo-touchdown-age-everything-to-know-about-the-rapper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teezo Touchdown Age: Everything To Know About The Rapper">&larr;
