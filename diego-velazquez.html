Ever since he was a little boy, he never wanted toys, costumes have been everything he ever wanted.</p><p>He would get hold of all of the costume catalogs and go through them for hours while Halloween was around the corner. He loved costumes and make-up so much that becoming a Special FX makeup artist was his alternative career choice. He went to work with his mother, who was a stylist for advertisements when he was about six years old.</p><p>He saw what the actors were doing there and found it interesting. He went home and told his mom that all he wanted to do was act. And as luck would have it, he secured his first acting project in the television film ‘Extraordinary Measures’ later that year with none other than Brendan Fraser and <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Harrison Ford" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Harrison Ford</a>.</p><p>Born on the 5th of December 2001 Diego Velazquez is currently 21 years old.

Velazquez has brown colored hair and the color of his eyes is brown as well.</p><p>After starting his career in acting at the young age of 7, Diego Velazquez started to receive bigger and better projects and became one of the most popular child actors after his appearance on Nickelodeon.</p><p>Diego has been a part of many high-grossing projects and has received fame and recognition for his acting talent. The total net worth estimated for Diego Velazquez is $300 thousand US dollars as of now.</p><p>The native of Oregon, Diego Velazquez was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, USA.

Billy Thunderman’s acting gave him a large fan base among youngsters.</p><p>He also appeared as Nathan Ford Young in ‘Leverage’ prior to ‘The Thundermans’.
