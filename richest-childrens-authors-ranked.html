With all of the information we absorb at a young age, there is no wonder that being a children’s author can be very rewarding. Speaking of rewards, a children’s author can start off small but eventually make a serious living! Adults that once read their favorite children’s book to sleep will eventually read it to their child.</p><p>This makes children authors’ works last forever to be discovered over and over again! Thus, long-lasting stories that children will ask their parents to read forever have made these 10 individuals the richest children’s authors of all time!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>One For The Books: 10 Most Expensive Literary Adaptation Movies Of All Time (& How Much They Cost)</a></span></p><h2 id=rachel-renee-russell>Rachel Renee Russell</h2><p>Rachel Renee Russell is first on our list of richest children’s authors of all time. Much like one of our future authors later on in the list, she has published a lot of children’s books that narrate the experiences of a kid going through life. Named the <i>Dork Diaries</i>, Rachel has made a name for herself in the children authors’ niche.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is certainly not the richest children’s author on this list, with a net worth of $7 million, but she is absolutely the most family-oriented. It is worth noting that the main character in her <i>Dork Diaries</i> is named after her youngest daughter. Even more impressive is that her daughter actually does the illustrations in her books!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest YA Authors Of All Time, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=rick-riordan>Rick Riordan</h2><p>Out next children’s author is Rick Riordan. He is particularly famous for his publications of Greek mythology-based novels. You might think that children wouldn't be&nbsp;so interested in these types of books. However, we all need a history lesson and you will definitely get one by opening up one of Rick’s books.</p><p>Widely known for a five-book series named <i>Percy Jackson and the <a href=#>Olympians</a>, </i>Riordan has made a pretty good living for himself. Capturing the imagery needed for mythology books, he is one of the most skilled writers there are! He has created over 20 books for children and is worth $9.5 million because of it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=c-s-lewis>C.S. Lewis</h2><p>The next children’s author on our list is C.S Lewis. This famous author is known for his <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i> books and associated movies. He brings imagination to his books that cannot be captured anywhere else. His great writing skills can be attributed to the particular way he writes for children.</p><p>He has said that he writes about things that he would have liked reading about when he was a child. Although, authors of our time make extremely more than that, in 1952 that amount of net worth was surely enough to deem him one of the richest children’s authors of all time!</p><h2 id=shel-silverstein>Shel Silverstein</h2><p>If you are like us and love a good book about things that typically scare children, then you probably have picked up one or two Shel Silverstein books. Although his books are not super scary, <a href=#><i>The Giving Tree</i> and <i>The Light in the Attic</i></a> are just two of Shel Silverstein’s books that have been in children’s hands for generations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shel Silverstein is known as a <a href=#>singer</a>, songwriter, poet, cartoonist, and screenwriter that made a great deal of money for his publications. Worth a solid $20 million at his time of death, Shel is absolutely one of our favorite and richest children’s authors!</p><h2 id=dr-seuss>Dr. Seuss</h2><p>If you grew up in America and have ever gone to a public library, you have definitely heard of <a href=#>Dr. Seuss</a>. With a net worth of $75 million, he has been one of the most influential children’s authors of all time. He also just happens to be one of the richest as well. Most famous for <i>The Cat in The Hat</i> and <i>The Lorax</i>, this noteworthy children’s author has published over 43 books.</p><p>As well-known for his whimsical illustrations as his stories, these books are still being read to this day and his stories are just as funny as they were when they were first created. This Springfield, Massachusetts native brings silliness and joy to his books and they will live on forever!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Authors Who Made Over A Million With Their First Book</a></span></p><h2 id=suzanne-collins>Suzanne Collins</h2><p>With a net worth of $80 million, Suzanne Collins deserves to be on this list of richest children’s authors of all time. She has had a lot of fame come from her <i>Hunger Games</i> novels and subsequent movies that followed. Although the actors playing the main characters in her novel-based films are getting a lot of clout nowadays, this edgy writer is getting all the attention in the books division. She has also written book series like <i>Clifford the Big Red Dog and</i><i>Wow Wow Wubbzy.</i> Suzanne Collins has a very dynamic children’s book arsenal, which pushes her past much of the competition!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeff-kinney>Jeff Kinney</h2><p>A net worth of over $100 million will definitely land you on this list of the richest children’s authors of all time.

This series features 13 extremely versatile and funny tales of a kid going through obstacles in life.</p><p>As a cartoonist, he also features great illustrations in his books that engage children first, encouraging them to read within. With a new book added into the series just last month, there is no question that Jeff will be making some substantial income from these publications.</p><h2 id=danielle-steel>Danielle Steel</h2><p><a href=#>Danielle Steel</a> is next on our list of the richest children’s authors because she has actually written an impressive number of children’s novels. Her <i>Freddie, Max and Martha</i> series’ are great children’s books. These books actually teach children about everyday events like going on a trip, being at a new school, and even having an accident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a net worth of $310 million, she is really catching the attention of children and they are loving the content that she is putting out.

She is widely known for this series and many others, including other children’s books. One could argue that the <i>Harry Potter</i> series is not for children. However, the subject matter explored in them is what make children actually read them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beginning in 1997, she released the first book of a series that would make her the richest children’s author of all time.
