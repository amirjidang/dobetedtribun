However, each generation has a handful of musicians who manage to beat the odds by being on top of the music world for years or even decades.Considering all the success she has enjoyed, it already is clear that <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> </strong>is one of the rare artists who stay on top for years. Furthermore, everything that is known about Swift's career to date indicates that she will continue to succeed and become a legitimate legend.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Now That Taylor Swift's Midnights Is Out, Fans Puzzled Together Her Hints From Months Ago</a></span>As anyone who has observed Swift's career will no doubt know, her music has earned her a huge and extremely devoted fan base. In fact, some of <a href=#>Swift's fans have done some crazy things</a> to express their adoration for the singer.On top of knowing all kinds of <a href=#>trivia about Swift</a>, many of the singer's fans also enjoy buying her merchandise. As it turns out, it is very clear that Swift has cashed a lot on those merchandise sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-does-taylor-swift-make-from-merchandise>How Much Money Does Taylor Swift Make From Merchandise?</h2><p>From the outside looking in, it is easy to feel like celebrities who are filthy rich don't necessarily care where their money comes from. In reality, however, the truth is that most wealthy celebrities have so much cash because they are shrewd enough to make as much money as possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Taylor Swift Earned $90 Million In 2020</a></span></p><p>Since Taylor Swift is one of those stars who is smart enough to maximize her money-making potential, it shouldn't surprise anyone that she sells a lot of merchandise. However, they may be left wondering how much money Swift brings in from merchandise alone.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Swift and her representatives don't put out statements about the singer's finances. As a result, there is no way to definitively state how much money Swift has made from merchandise each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side for anyone curious about Swift's merchandise sales, they also aren't a complete mystery.</p><p>In 2014, Buzzfeed published an article about how Swift gets paid. According to that article, Swift sold $17 worth of merchandise on average to the people who attended her concerts at that time.</p><p>Extrapolating from that information and the number of concert tickets that Swift sold back then, Buzzfeed estimated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she made eight figures annually</a> from her concert merchandise sales. Of course, over the last eight years, inflation has caused the price of things like merchandise to balloon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of selling merchandise at her concerts, Swift has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an online store where fans can buy a wide array of items</a> dedicated to her. Amazingly enough, Swift has so much merchandise for sale online that her online store is broken up into categories dedicated to her various albums.</p><p>Keeping in mind how many devoted fans Swift has and how much is available for them to buy, it is reasonable to assume she brings in millions in merch sales from her website.</p><p>Based on all the available information, it seems very likely that Swift brings in tens of millions of dollars in merchandise sales annually. However, it is important to note that Swift almost certainly makes a lot less money from merch sales during any years in which she doesn't tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-taylor-swift-worth>How Much Money Is Taylor Swift Worth?</h2><p>Once you get a ballpark idea of how much money Taylor Swift makes from merchandise alone, it begs an obvious question, how much money is she worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Ex-Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Given that Swift has been a superstar for years, it likely won't surprise anyone that the immensely popular singer has a truly impressive fortune. However, it is still staggering to know that Swift has a $400 net worth as of this writing according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p>Of course, it should go without saying that Swift's reported $450 million fortune makes her a lot wealthier than almost all of her peers. However, it is worth noting that figure will likely continue to get larger in the years to come.</p><p>On top of estimating her current fortune, celebritynetworth.com reports that Swift also makes an estimated $150 million annually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/taylor-swift-concert.jpg><p>When considering the future outlook for Swift's fortune, it is important to remember that her annual salary isn't all that matters. After all, the vast majority of rich and famous people like Swift have loads of expenses due to their affluent lifestyles.</p><p>Even with that in mind, it is still feasible that Swift could become a billionaire someday if she continues to be so shrewd and successful. If that never happens, it is still mind-boggling that she has amassed a fortune in the hundreds of millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW65wKScZqWVp7Cprc2doKydXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-joe-mixon-mother-a-single-parent-everything-to-know-about-his-childhood-days.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Joe Mixon Mother A Single Parent?
