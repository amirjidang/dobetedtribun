She is continuously accused of getting fillers - and she's definitely not the only one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock's amazing looks were also questioned</a> and we were all shocked when Jennifer Lopez could rock the Super Bowl halftime show at the age of 50. Unrelenting critics seem to forget that these women made a living out of staying in shape and healthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As an advisor on The Voice</a>, Gwen Stefani thrived right in front of our eyes and her youthful appearance continuously took our breaths away. She openly shared how she manages to stay so youthful. Let's see what she has to say about it.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-wears-sunscreen-everywhere-she-goes><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gwen Stefani Wears Sunscreen Everywhere She Goes</span></h2><p>We all know that wearing sunscreen is the number one rule in skincare, but we tend to forget it or not take it seriously unless the sun is blazing outside. Gwen Stefani always makes sure to wear it, even if it's raining. If you want to look forever young, go get yourself some sunscreen. It doesn't need to be anything fancy. After all, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Jenner uses a drugstore brand</a>.</p><h2 id=and-avoids-sun-in-general><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>... And Avoids Sun In General</span></h2><p>Putting sunscreen on is not enough: Gwen Stefani makes sure to avoid direct sunlight on her face by walking around with a parasol. It's not as hot and it can serve as a quirky accessory. Do not sizzle on the beach when the sun is at its highest: you're doing your skin no favors whatsoever. Avoiding the sun is the best long-term investment if you want to look as young as Gwen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=letting-the-skin-breathe-at-least-at-night><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Letting The Skin Breathe (At Least At Night)</span></h2><p>No wonder everyone suspects that Gwen Stefani got plastic surgery. Her all-natural selfie reveals that she looks decades younger than she actually is. Another one of her secrets is always making sure that she removes all makeup before going to bed so her skin can breathe. She also takes days-off from makeup and shows the world how beautiful she is without it.</p><h2 id=love-overpowers-the-effects-of-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Love Overpowers The Effects Of Time</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton met in 2014 and whenever she's by his side, she's literally glowing. Being in love keeps her looking so young - she has said so herself. They have been dating since 2015 and they still look just as infatuated with each other as they did when the romance first blossomed. Blake claims that Gwen saved his life after he went through a difficult divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwen-stefani-is-mindful-of-how-much-water-she-s-drinking><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gwen Stefani Is Mindful Of How Much Water She's Drinking</span></h2><p>Just like sunscreen, there's another no-brainer in her beauty routine. She makes sure to drink enough water every day. We all know we should be doing it too, yet not many manage to drink the required minimum of 3 liters a day. Being dehydrated leads to fatigue and tired-looking skin. No wonder Gwen's skin looks so radiant if she makes sure to drink plenty of water.</p><h2 id=sleep-and-rest-are-important><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sleep And Rest Are Important</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani makes sure to always get her beauty sleep or at least a chance to rest during her super-stressful days. She never skips the process of removing her makeup beforehand. When she's feeling tired, she knows how to conceal it, which leads us to our next point.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-has-mastered-the-make-up-game><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gwen Stefani Has Mastered The Make-Up Game</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani knows and loves makeup inside and out. Her lipstick pretty much became her signature look and it diverts attention from any other possible imperfections - not that she has any. Gwen knows exactly what looks good on her. After all, she's been an avid makeup enthusiast since she was a teenager. Those who understand makeup can make themselves seem years younger than they actually are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stunning Photos Of Gwen Stefani That'll Make Every Guy Jealous</a></span></p><h2 id=cardio-exercise-four-times-a-week><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cardio Exercise Four Times A Week</span></h2><p>No pain, no gain. Gwen Stefani works out at least four times a week. These are no laid-back easy workouts, though. They are high-intensity and she barely takes a rest between different exercises. She claims <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her routine is hell</a> - but the results are definitely worth it. Besides taking care of her body, she also takes care of her mental and spiritual well-being.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Gwen Stefani With No Makeup On</a></span></p><h2 id=striving-for-a-plant-based-diet-works-wonders><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Striving For A Plant-Based Diet Works Wonders</span></h2><p>She doesn't label herself as a vegan, but she does strive to follow a vegan diet. She's been a vegetarian for most of her life and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's trying to get Blake Shelton to follow suit</a>. She also avoids carbs. You might be wondering what else is there to eat then? Well, fresh produce is the secret to looking so young and fresh all the time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Interesting Facts About Gwen Stefani You Probably Didn’t Know About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=long-days-call-for-a-complete-make-up-re-do><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Long Days Call For A Complete Make-Up Re-Do</span></h2><p>On her long days, Gwen removes her makeup halfway through and starts over. That way, she looks like she just woke up. When we wear makeup throughout the whole day, we might end up looking like tired raccoons - that never happens to Gwen.</p><p>To sum up, Gwen Stefani mostly follows common sense in order to stay so young and healthy. She also knows how to use makeup to her best advantage.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani And Blake Shelton Buy A Top Secret $13 Million Love Pad</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnMSmuoysq56ekaO2brPErWSppJGowaqvjKysq5%2BVp8Zw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harry-fraud-talks-high-tide-reveals-new-edm-track-down-down-154492.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Fraud Talks High Tide, Reveals New EDM Track Down Down">&larr;
