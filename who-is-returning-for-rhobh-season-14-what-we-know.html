As the last remaining OG cast member, fans have been waiting for confirmation that Kyle has signed on to hold a diamond again.</p><p class=p1>Kyle, who was mourning the loss of childhood best friend Lorene, had a difficult season 13 with her costars questioning her decision to <a href=#>stop drinking</a>, her weight loss (she <a href=#>denied that</a> she had taken Ozempic) and her marital issues. (<i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed in July 2023 that Kyle and estranged husband <strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong> had separated after two decades of marriage.)</p><p class=p1>After the season wrapped airing in March, Kyle noted that it could be beneficial to take a mental health break by going on pause from the show.</p><p class=p1>“It was difficult shooting the season because I was going through stuff in my marriage, but our daughters didn’t know, and I didn’t feel like sharing it on camera quite yet,” Kyle told <i>Us </i>in <a href=#>her December 2023 cover story</a>. “But I was honest with the [cast]. When they started grilling me, I was like, ‘Why are you acting like I haven’t been honest? I told you it’s the worst year we’ve ever had.’ Did they want me to take them inside my bedroom? I don’t know what they wanted me to do. I felt like people I considered my friends hurt me.”</p><p class=p1>Keep scrolling for a complete breakdown of the <i>RHOBH </i>cast and whether they plan to return for another season:</p><h3 class=p3><b>Kyle Richards</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-6.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Returning</p><p class=p1>Eagle-eyed fans <a href=#>spotted her filming</a> alongside other RHOBH cast members on May 12. Kyle was previously unsure whether she would be stepping back into the Bravo spotlight.</p><p class=p1>“People keep asking me, ‘Are you going to come back? Are you going to leave?’” she told <i>Extra</i> in March. “It’s always something <a href=#>I decide last-minute</a>, sort of.”</p><p class=p1>Two months later during a May Amazon Live session, Kyle reiterated that she “can’t confirm” that she will return but denied that she had posed an ultimatum.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t even know what I’m doing yet, guys, so that can’t be true,” she added.</p><h3 class=p3><b>Dorit Kemsley</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-8.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Returning</p><p class=p1>Dorit was also spotted at the May 12 event, filming alongside Kyle and other members of the RHOBH cast. Rumors previously swirled online that the fashion designer could appear in a smaller role as a “friend.” Bravo did not comment on the speculation.</p><p class=p1>In May, Dorit announced her separation from husband <strong>Paul “PK” Kemsley</strong>&nbsp;in a statement, which read, “We as a couple have been subject to a lot of speculation about our marriage. We have had our struggles over the last few years and continue to work through them as two people who love each other and share two amazing children together.”</p><p>She continued: “To safeguard our deep friendship and maintain a harmonious environment for our children we have made the mutual and difficult decision to take some time apart and reevaluate our relationship while we prioritize our children.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>Erika Jayne</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-3.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Returning</p><p class=p1>Fans also clocked Erika, 52, at the event in May, confirming her return to the show. The singer is currently happy with her new chapter since filing for divorce from <strong>Tom Girardi</strong>, being dismissed from his fraud lawsuit and headlining her own Las Vegas residency.</p><p class=p1>“I’m happy to have come this far. I’m happy to have had the chance to start over and go forward, and life is much better than it has been,”<a href=#><span class=s1> she told <i>Us</i></span></a><i> </i>in March. “You have to pick yourself up and you have to put one foot in front of the other. It really is baby step, baby step, baby step. And then those steps become a little bit bigger and bigger.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>Garcelle Beauvais</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-2.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Returning</p><p class=p1>Garcelle, 57, was not photographed at the same event as her fellow RHOBH stars, but there were reports of her attendance. Last month, Garcelle told <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s1><i>Access Hollywood</i></span></a> that she “is not allowed to say” whether she would be returning to the show.</p><p class=p1>“I have nothing to do with casting,” Garcelle added.</p><h3 class=p3><b>Sutton Stracke</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-4.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Returning</p><p class=p1>Considering Sutton was the May party’s host, she’ll be back in the fold for season 14.

Every single year I was asked back, it was a blessing. It was an honor.”</p><p class=p1>A source<a href=#> later confirmed to <i>Us </i></a>that Crystal was fired “because she didn’t deliver” on story lines. Per the insider, production did not have a plot line in mind for Crystal going into the new season.</p><h3 class=p3><b>Annemarie Wiley</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Season-14-Casting-Breakdown-7.jpg><p class=p1>Housewives Status: Fired</p><p class=p1>Annemarie, 40, got her diamond for <i>RHOBH </i>season 13 only to return it the next year.</p><p class=p1>“I’m disappointed is an understatement,” she said in a March <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a> statement. “I never auditioned for this show. The show found me and asked me to be on it out of the blue 6 weeks after the cast had already started filming. I was thrown into filming 2 weeks later, mid-season. I was very excited about the opportunity, and I thought following exactly what I was instructed to do throughout filming last season was the way the ‘game was played.’”</p><h3 class=p1><b>Bozoma Saint John</b></h3><p class=p1>Status: Joining</p><p class=p1>The marketing exec, who briefly served as CMO at Netflix, will be picking up a diamond for season 14.</p><h3 class=p1><b>Kathy Hilton</b></h3><p class=p1>Status: Returning</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Bravo confirmed in May 2024 that Kathy will be back for season 14 as a “friend.”</p><h3 class=p1><b>Jennifer Tilly</b></h3><p class=p1>Status: Joining</p><p class=p1>Jennifer briefly appeared in an episode of <i>RHOBH </i>season 13, having lunch with Sutton.
