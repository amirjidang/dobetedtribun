Many of the established celebrities, of this time, have had to achieve the status by the sweat of their brows. Others were luckier. Fans assume that their favorite celebrities normally travel in rosy roads without bumps or potholes. Forget about scandals and challenges associated to success. We’re looking at poverty that makes minimum wage sound better. Very few celebrities were born in the lime light. For some, their lives were darker than Friday the 13th itself, before God intervened and opened doors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have stories that will inspire the masses, It’s usually hard to picture such celebrities being homeless, sleeping hungry or being forced to use public transportation. Truth of the matter is that&nbsp;they've&nbsp;been there,&nbsp;they've&nbsp;done that. There are celebrities who lived this life of torment for years, barely making ends meet. Others, conversely, experienced it for shorter time periods. Without much further ado, here is the list of the top 10 poorest, before they were propelled into&nbsp;super-stardom:</p><h2 id=1-mariah-carey><b>1. </b><a title="Mariah Carey Net Worth" href=#><b>Mariah Carey</b></a></h2><p>Before growing into a household name worldwide, Mariah was as poor as it gets. She was raised by both her parents, in Long Island, in one of the most underprivileged neighborhoods. Toys were a luxury she never owned. Out of boredom and depression, she poisoned her dog one day. Her luck changed after moving to New York. It was while at a party there when she met an executive from Columbia Records. Soon afterwards, she was able to woo the entire world with her beautiful voice, building an empire worth millions today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-justin-bieber><b>2. </b><a title="Justin Bieber Net Worth" href=#><b>Justin Bieber</b></a></h2><p>Although critics usually despise his style, terming his lyrics as ‘watered down’, not many could have risen so fast from the depths that Justin came from. A couple of years ago, he was just another poor boy living in a house infested by rats and cockroaches. Many are the times he went to bed hungry, which was actually a pull-out couch, for lack of food. At the moment, Justin is one of the wealthiest teens in America with a net worth of approx $65 million.</p><h2 id=3-halle-berry><b>3. </b><a title="Halle Berry Net Worth" href=#><b>Halle Berry</b></a></h2><h2></h2><p>This award winning actress&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;always have things handed to her. When in her early 20s, Halle Berry decided to move to New York to try her luck as an actress or model. At first, she was forced to live in a homeless shelter for a while, before things started to look up. Despite the financial constraints she experienced, she never lost hope or asked her parents for help. She pressed on until winning Oscar Awards was no longer a dream but reality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-snoop-dogg><b>4. </b><a title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth" href=#><b>Snoop Dogg</b></a></h2><p>Many rappers&nbsp;who've&nbsp;made it big in the industry share a similar story to Snoop—drug dealing. Wearing shoes worth $1 then, this&nbsp;Multi-Grammy award winner was forced to resort to illegal street activities to earn a living. After being arrested several times, he opted to try Hip Hop as his salvation. He started making video tapes with Warren G, Dr. Dre’s half brother, which gradually changed his life for the better. He met Dre, soon afterwards, who agreed to become his producer and, well… the rest is history.</p><h2 id=5-jay-z><b>5. </b><a title="Jay-Z Net Worth" href=#><b>Jay Z</b></a></h2><p>Jay grew in poverty and according to him; bread was a luxury his family&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;afford. He was tired of always being broke and of the rampant violence in his neighborhood. His ambitions finally paid off and he was able to move out of the hood, ending up as one of the richest rappers in history. Jay has managed to build an empire and marrying one of the hottest song birds in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-mark-walhberg><b>6.&nbsp;</b><b>Mark Walhberg</b></h2><p>At the tender age of 14, Mark quit school and joined one of the local gangs in his neighborhood. It was his ambition for making fast money that landed him into jail. He was lucky to receive a light sentence of only 50 days in jail. When he was released, his older brother, Donnie, convinced him to abandon the street. Then, he helped him to get a record deal that consequently brought unimaginable share of fortune and fame onto his plate.</p><h2 id=7-leonardo-dicaprio><b>7.&nbsp;</b><a title="Leonardo DiCaprio Net Worth" href=#><b>Leonardo DiCaprio</b></a></h2><p>Before the actor became famous, he was constantly in debt and&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;even find a well-paying job. Despite growing up in Hollywood, it took quite a while before Leo was able to land solid acting gigs. His company was mostly composed of prostitutes and drug dealers at that time. Keeping his eyes on the prize, Leo was able to abandon that lifestyle and thus landing acting gigs. One gig after another, he was able to climb to the top and join the list of the most paid actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-demi-moore><b>8. </b><a title="Demi Moore Net Worth" href=#><b>Demi Moore</b></a></h2><p>For a large part of her childhood years, Demi lived inside a trailer park. To make matters worse, her father was an alcoholic. Instead of working, he used to drink heavily, turning to his daughter and abusing her, repeatedly. After deciding enough was enough, when only 16 years old, Demi dropped out of school, ran away from home and went to Hollywood, to try her luck. Things later turned out better for her as soon as she landed her first acting gig.</p><h2 id=9-j-k-rowling><b>9.&nbsp;</b><a title="J.K. Rowling Net Worth" href=#><b>J.K. Rowling</b></a></h2><p>Prior to Rowling stumbling upon her fortune, she was living off welfare. She was struggling to put food on her table and paying school fees for her kids. One day, while waiting for her train, which was delayed for 4 hours, an idea of a small wizard boy popped into her head. It was then that she came up with the <i>Harry Porter</i> series which made her one of England’s richest. Presently, Rowling’s net worth is more than $1 billion.</p><h2 id=10-jim-carrey><b>10.&nbsp;</b><a title="Jim Carrey Net Worth" href=#><b>Jim Carrey</b></a></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a child, Jim’s family was very poor and they used to live in a Camper van. To earn and help out with finances at home, the teenage Jim resorted to working. The full shifts at the tire factory where he was working drained his energy and this is when he decided to move to Hollywood. As fate would have it, he met Rodney Dangerfield who helped him in becoming one of the best paid actors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5z6imq52jqXqjscWoqZ5lpJ2yunnBnpqapZVisKa4xJupoqyZmsBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./track-days-shark-tank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Track Days Shark Tank  Founder, Net Worth and Investment">&larr;
