But on a darker note, Stacey was also in the <a href=# id=auto-tag_news_3 data-tag=news>news</a> this month for </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>pressing charges against her physically abusive third husband</span></a><span>. VIBE caught up with the chestnut beauty to talk intellectual rappers and leaving bad boys behind. —</span><span>Tracy Garraud</span></span></strong><span id=more-40705></span></p><p><span><strong>VIBE: So how did you end up on a motorcyle with Rick Ross?</strong></span><span><br></span><strong><span>Stacey Dash:</span></strong><span> F. Gary Gray called me and he’s a director that I wanted to work with for a very long time. He’s like ‘Look I’m doing this music video, it’s based around Harley Davidson and it’s going to be amazing, will you do it with me?’ I said, ‘Of course! You’re F. Gary Gray! I love your vision, yes!</span></p><p><strong><span>Nice, when did you guys film?</span></strong><span><br>We shot it Sunday and Monday at Palm Desert—both 18-hour workdays.</span></p><p><strong><span>What’s your role in the video?</span></strong><span><br>I play the video vixen. I’m in a Lamborghini and he pulls up on me. I’m not having a good time with my man and he’s like ‘Come with me.’ There’s about 20 guys in Harley bikes surrounding me. I’m like ‘Heck yeah, I’m getting on the bike!’</span></p><p><strong><span>Are you hesitant about being in rappers’ music videos?</span></strong><span><br>Not at all. Work is work. And if it’s something that you like and are getting paid, I wouldn’t be hesitant to do it all. If it was something where I didn’t like the concept and it was just some <a href=# id=auto-tag_mickey-mouse_3 data-tag=mickey-mouse>Mickey Mouse</a> director, that’s different.</span></p><p><strong><span>How familiar were you with Ross’ work?</span></strong><span><br>I wasn’t very familiar. Kinda. I heard a couple songs that I liked and then I asked around some people I know [</span><span>laughs</span><span>] and listened to “Super High” and liked it a lot.</span></p><p><strong><span>What were you asking people?</span></strong><span><br>I was asking people in [the] business what they thought of him. They said ‘Oh he’s a good rapper, he’s solid.’</span></p><p><strong><span>Would you hang out with him outside of work?</span></strong><span><br>Oh, absolutely. He’s so nice. I can see that. I like him. And he’s smart.</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p><strong><span>Is he a serious kind of guy?</span></strong><span><br>He’s quiet and I’m quiet so it’s really good. When words are spoken, they mean something.</span></p><p><strong><span>What about Game, how’d that video happen?</span></strong><span><br>We did a movie together [a year ago]—that I’m pretty sure is not coming out—and became friends. So you know, he called me and said ‘Please’ and I said ‘Okay.’</span></p><p><strong><span>What movie was this?</span></strong><span><br>I don’t even want to talk about, if it comes out great, if it doesn’t fine. Unfortunately, they didn’t have enough money to make a movie and they tried. We did finish I think. It was not a very…I don’t know if it’s coming out.</span></p><p><strong><span>Game’s video looks a bit more typical of a hip-hop video then Ross’. What was his pitch to you?</span></strong><span><br>His pitch was ‘I’m doing a video, I need you to come at 4 o’clock in the morning to be the girl that I wake up to. I’m like ‘Ugh, really? He’s like ‘Please.’ I said ‘Ugh, really.’ He says ‘Please.’ I couldn’t say no. [</span><span>Laughs</span><span>]</span></p><p><strong><span>Yeah, those naked girls on the couch caught me off guard.</span></strong><span><br>He knew I would have no part in that. I’m [said] ‘Once that sun rises, I’m out.’ And that was it. I got there, I shot it and I left.</span></p><p><strong><span>Is Game smart like Ross too?</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br>Game is highly intelligent. He’s even educated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>What are your conversations with him like?</span></strong><span><br>We have all kinds, from politics, to finances, to life, to religion. He’s an intelligent man. That’s what I hope gets exposed about him. Which is why I did my part in his video. I want him to expose that side of himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>What’s stopping him?</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br>He says everything is about timing. He’s just such an intelligent man and no one knows. He’s articulate as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>So you guys kind of made a deal?</span></strong><span><br>Yeah, he promises that eventually it’s going to happen. I’m holding him to it. And I think he has a great voice for rap. I think his voice is amazing, so I would love to hear him rap some… stuff. [</span><span>Laughs</span><span>]</span></p><p><strong><span>I was surprised to hear that your most recent husband, Emmanuel Xuereb, was physically abusive towards you. TMZ put up the legal paper, but did you ever want the public to know?</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6t6psTCpaysoaaaerTAwJycsmWUlsCpedOao6SrXae2pLeMq6asq12rtqWxzmaYm62jnsOmecSxnKxlkaOxbrPAppysZZyewbW4xGaqnpuimsFugI9wZ25n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tennie-james-height-age-who-wife-biography-wiki-net-worth-19983-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tennie James Height, Age, Who, wife, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth">&larr;
