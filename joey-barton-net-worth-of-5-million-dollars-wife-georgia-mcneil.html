In the Premier League, he made 269 appearances, including 130 for Manchester City. Bristol Rovers of League One is now under his leadership.</p><p>Barton was raised in Huyton, Merseyside, where he was born. After advancing through their junior system, he signed up with Manchester City in 2002 to start his professional career. Over the next five years, his first team appearances rapidly grew, and he eventually made more than 150 for the squad.</p><p>Despite his criticism of a few of the team’s players, he received his lone cap for England in February 2007.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts-on-joey-barton></span>Quick Facts On Joey Barton<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Joey Barton</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth</strong></td><td>2 September 1982</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of birth</strong></td><td>Huyton, England</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Midfielder</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Georgia McNeil</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joey-barton-net-worth-in-2022></span>Joey Barton Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joey Barton has a $5 million net worth from his football career and uses that money to live a luxurious lifestyle.</p><p>He joined Newcastle United in July 2007 for £5.8 million. He left the team after four years and joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, where he spent the 2012 season on loan to Marseille. The next season, when he returned from his loan assignment, he assisted QPR in advancing through the Championship play-offs to the Premier League.</p><p>However, QPR was once more demoted, and Barton was fired at the conclusion of the campaign. In May 2016, he left Burnley to join Rangers after signing a one-year contract to play for them in 2015. He helped them gain promotion to the Premier League.</p><p>After pleading guilty to a betting-related Football Association allegation in April 2017, he was given a football suspension that expired in June 2018, at which point he started managing Fleetwood Town.</p><p>Barton has had multiple contentious events, disciplinary issues, and convictions for violent offenses during his career and life. He received a six-month prison term on May 20, 2008, for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Center.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-look-at-joey-barton-career-so-far></span>A Look At Joey Barton Career So Far<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Barton joined the Everton youth program to pursue his goal of playing professional football, but when he was 14 he began playing for Liverpool. He went through trials with Nottingham Forest but was turned down because he was deemed too little to play football.</p><p>Barton claimed that being rejected by clubs just strengthened his will to excel as a footballer and disprove his critics. In 1999, he made his debut for Manchester City’s under-17 squad. In his last year as a trainee, he made his debut with the reserve squad after the 2000–01 campaign.</p><p>He was set to be released by the team because they were unsure of his future possibilities, but they later changed their minds and offered him his first professional contract during the offseason.</p><p>He transitioned from the under-19s to regular reserve football over the following two years. In the 2002–03 season, he was elevated to the first-team group.</p><p>Barton returned to Burnley on January 2, 2017, despite the possibility of an FA ban, and made his second Burnley debut in a scoreless draw with Sunderland in the FA Cup third round. On January 14, Barton made his league comeback. He replaced another player in the 73rd minute, and five minutes later, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=married-life-of-joey-barton-georgia-mcneil-and-court-hearing></span>Married Life Of Joey Barton Georgia McNeil And Court Hearing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Georgia McNeil is the wife of Joey Barton, an English football player, and coach. On their daughter’s fifth birthday in June 2019, Georgia and Joey were married with a wedding ceremony in Branbury’s Aynhoe Park.</p><p>Barton welcomed a child on December 28, 2011. Cassius, a son, was born to him and Georgia McNeil. McNeil gave birth to a daughter called Pietà, the couple’s second child, on June 6, 2014.</p><p>Michael Barton, the brother of Barton, received a life sentence for his part in the 2005 racial homicide of Anthony Walker. Following the attack, Joey publicly pleaded with his brother to cooperate with the police investigation and made several calls to Michael to find out if he had any participation in the crime.</p><p>Ricky Hatton is a friend of his, and he has trained with him and supported him in some of his bouts. He is also good friends with Noel Gallagher, a former member of Oasis. Along with fellow football player Claudio Pizarro, Barton shares ownership of the racehorse “Crying Lightning.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joey-barton-cleared-of-beating-his-wife-georgia></span>Joey Barton Cleared Of Beating His Wife Georgia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After a court determined that Joey Barton could not have a fair trial, he was found not guilty of beating his wife.</p><p>Georgia Barton was not called to testify by the prosecution at Wimbledon Magistrate’s Court of concern that she would provide an “exculpatory testimony” to support her husband.</p><p>Mr. Barton, who currently oversees Bristol Rovers, was detained last year after being accused of kicking and pushing Mrs. Barton to the ground.</p><p>The court heard the alleged attack happened in June 2021 during “a drunken argument” at the couple’s house in Kew, south-west London.
