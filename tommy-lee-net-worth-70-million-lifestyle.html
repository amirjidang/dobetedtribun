But he's like any other rockstar, who makes millions. He likes to spend those millions on extravagant things, and with a net worth of $70 million, he can afford to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee has the biggest net worth out of all his bandmates in Motley Crue</a>, and he's bought mansions big enough to fit a small town, has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a car collection that rivals Kid Rock's</a>, and has tons of gorgeous motorcycles, but how else does he spend his millions?</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">you might want to ignore some things about Lee</a>, how he spends his money shouldn't be one of them because it's highly entertaining. If you've seen Netflix's&nbsp;The Dirt you'll understand.</p><h2 id=how-he-racked-up-70-million>How He Racked Up $70 Million</h2><p>If you know anything about Motley Crue, you'll know that they were one of the biggest bands in the '80s, one that not only destroyed in the charts but literally everywhere they went, one hotel at a time. These were the guys that played a grotesque game of who can do the craziest thing with Ozzy Osbourne and who literally tried to shoot alcohol into their veins like heroin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But they came out of the '80s and '90s pretty much still intact for the most part, and with a hefty about of change too. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee made 20 albums with Crue</a>, six of which turned platinum. When he was done making millions with the band, he moved on to form a rap-metal band, Methods of Mayhem, in 1999.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">19 Photos Of Tommy Lee And Brittany Furlan That Prove Age Is Just A Number</a></span></p><p>Later on, Lee released his first solo album, Never a Dull Moment, in 2002. Two years later he reunited with Crue to make a double-CD anthology album called Red, White, & Crüe which went quadruple platinum and spurred a highly successful tour with 81 shows.</p><p>In 2005, Lee had a brief reality show called Tommy Lee Goes to College, and released his autobiography, Tommyland,&nbsp;which came with his second solo album, Tommyland: The Ride.</p><p>This year was supposed to see Lee back on tour with Crue with other bands like Poison, Def Lepard, and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, but obviously, it got postponed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-he-spends-his-money-on>What He Spends His Money On</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee bought his Calabasas mansion for $5.85 million in 2007</a>, but it is currently back on the market for $4.59 million. It was previously going for $4.65 million in 2018 and $6 million when he first put it on the market in 2016. It sits in a quiet cul-de-sac in the gated community of Vista Point.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts About Tommy Lee And Pamela Anderson's Kids</a></span></p><p>The 10,000-square-foot, three-floored-mansion has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms,&nbsp;an atrium with indoor waterfalls, a retractable glass roof, a koi pond, a stone saltwater spa, a saltwater piano-shaped pool, a full gym, home theater, wine room, a second kitchen, and an outdoor area with a barbecue, fireplaces, and torch lighting.</p><p>It was truly made for a rockstar though because Lee converted the 13-car garage into a recording studio equipped with a control room with soundboards, and two sound-proof booths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lee also probably took a good chunk of money out to furnish the huge Californian house. It has everything from regal dining chairs and huge king-sized beds, to huge mirrors and statues of Buddha.</p><p>Lee previously owned a Spanish villa-style mansion with then-wife, Pamela Anderson, which had similar features as&nbsp;his Calabasas home. The home was on the market for $3 million in 2018, so Lee probably paid a similar price for it.</p><p>As for cars, Lee has owned tons and has once said that he was obsessed with having a luxury car collection. He has a 1968 Chevy Impala that he paid $10,000 for and spent another $40,000 on customizations.&nbsp;He also used to own a&nbsp;Ferrari Testarossa with vanity plates, which had the license plate number, “ROCNROL”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Women Tommy Lee Dated (5 Who Would Say No)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lee recently posted a video on his Instagram of all the cars he has. The collection consists of mainly Rolls Royce cars, or "RollLee's, as Lee calls them. There are five Rolls Royce, an Audi, a Ferrari, and a Maybach. He also has an environmentally-friendly Karma Fisker hybrid sports car as well.</p><p>If you've ever seen the video for Motley Crue's song "Girls, Girls, Girls", you'll know that he is also really obsessed with custom motorcycles.</p><p>Along with his real estate and obsessions with cars and motorcycles, Lee has also probably spent a lot of money on alcohol and other questionable substances, along with musical equipment, tons of vacations, expensive clothes, and the engagement rings for the seven women he has been engaged to in the past, including the three women he never actually got to marry.&nbsp;Lee has been married four times, so all those weddings&nbsp;combined couldn't have been cheap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are also the costs of all three of his divorces, especially the one from Anderson, who he probably had to pay child support to for their two sons. Lee also spent six months in jail in 1998, for kicking Anderson while she was holding their son Dylan, so there were probably some fines in there as well.</p><p>On top of all that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee has also made fans privy to all that he's spent on his son Brandon</a>, who he's had altercations with in the past. "Rehab for son: $130,000, Party for son’s 21st birthday last year: $40,000," Lee wrote. "Medical Bills after son knocks his father unconscious and uses ‘alcoholism’ as scapegoat: $10,000, Son acting like a victim on social media on father’s day: Priceless."</p><p>So all in all, it's a good thing that Lee has such an impressive net worth because he needs it to fuel his obsessions, his divorces, and any other thing he so desires as a rockstar. But he can spend it because those Motley Crue royalties keep rolling in just as fast as his Rolls Royce. No doubt Crue's upcoming tour will be able to make back some of those bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson v.
