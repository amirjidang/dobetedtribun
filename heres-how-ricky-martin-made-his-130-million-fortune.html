In 1999, Ricky Martin released his first album to be entirely in the English language. Martin's tour, which lasted for a whole year and was called the Livin' la Vida Loca Tour, was a smashing success in October 1999. In addition to his many other accomplishments, Martin has sold over 70 million albums and has 95 recordings certified as platinum.</p><p>Martin got his start in the <a href=#>music industry</a> at the age of 12 when he joined the boy band Menudo. After spending five years with the group, he went on to release a number of Spanish-language solo albums throughout the 1990s.</p><h2 id=ricky-s-early-life-amp-struggle>Ricky's Early Life & Struggle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On December 24, 1971, Enrique Martin Morales was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His hometown is San Juan. In a Roman Catholic home, he and his four brothers and one sister grew up alongside their psychologist father. He was the youngest of five children.

His interest in singing was sparked at a young age, and by the time he was six years old, he was already singing along to the <a href=#>English and Latin pop songs</a> that were his favorites. The fact that Enrique's grandmother was a poet served as inspiration for him to get started writing music.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Russell Peters Became One Of The Biggest Comedians In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-a-marvelous-music-career>The Beginning Of A Marvelous Music Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After participating in three auditions in 1984, Martin was invited to become a member of the Latin boy band Menudo.
