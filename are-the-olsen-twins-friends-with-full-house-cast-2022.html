The twins were the only main cast members from the original show that didn't make an appearance in the sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sequel's executive producers revealed that they reached out to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen about appearing on the show, but that the twins <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't feel comfortable joining the cast</a>. However, Mary-Kate seemed keener on making a cameo, and until season three of Fuller House<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producers have been reaching out to the twins</a> trying to make Michelle Tanner have an appearance on the show. Unfortunately for fans, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen never appeared in the sequel which aired its final fifth season in 2020.</p><h2 id=are-the-olsen-twins-friends-with-anyone-from-39-full-house-39>Are The Olsen Twins Friends With Anyone From 'Full House'?</h2><p>While many assumed that the reason Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen didn't join Fuller House is its cast — that couldn't be further from the truth.

"I remember trying to get them on Fuller House and they didn't want to come in or there was some miscommunication, or whatever it was – it was blown out of proportion," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stamos said</a>. He also revealed that his co-star Lori Loughlin (who plays his wife Becky) told him that the Olsen twins had won several Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. "That's like winning an Oscar. It's like 'Oh okay, that makes sense.' It's really inspiring. It's just strange to think of them as those little kids. Now they're such smart, powerful, important women. And they were smart, powerful, important kids too, but it's just great to see."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Say Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Advice To Their Little Sister Is 'Troubling'">Fans Say Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Advice To Their Little Sister Is 'Troubling'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When their co-star their Full House co-star, Bob Saget, died earlier this year, the Olsen twins <a href=#>released an emotional joint statement honoring him</a>.
