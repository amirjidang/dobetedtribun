After teaching math through the Corps and returning to college, he streamlined his career to a software services company to gain experience. With enough capital and willpower, he co-founded his first business, which was a software company. The idea to establish came to Hastings while renting DVDs and seeing the severe charges applied by rental establishments in America. With the change in technology and access, <a href=#>Netflix has updated itself to stream and produce content seen</a> by over two hundred million around the world. As one of the most valuable entertainment companies with Hastings as the co-CEO, <a href=#>Netflix has reached new heights each year</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rise of Netflix was slow and steady, and with the help of the dot-com boom, the streaming platform received further reach to audiences worldwide. The creator Reed Hastings highlighted a new way to stream content and revolutionized the entertainment world. Let’s look at the story of Reed Hastings, the founder, and co-CEO of Netflix.</p><h2 id=discovering-adventures>Discovering Adventures</h2><p>Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr., better known as Reed Hastings, hails from Massachusetts, where his father worked as an attorney for Richard Nixon’s office. After graduating high school, he took the role of a vacuum salesperson and traveled door-to-door to sell the products. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Reed went to Maine’s Bowdoin College and spent his time in the summer training for the Marine Corps as he had plans to join the group after completing college. After college, he joined the Peace Corps and traveled to Swaziland as a math tutor. His struggles and hard work in Africa helped him become patient and self-aware.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Check Out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Insane Collection Of Homes</a></span></p><p>Hastings also focused on returning to school and applied to several graduate schools in America. While he wanted to go to MIT for further studies, he was rejected and <a href=#>went to Stanford instead</a>. As noted by Britannica, he received a Master’s in Computer Science, which helped him find work in the software development industry. His work with Adaptive Technology helped him establish his company, Pure Software, in 1991. The company's success allowed it to become public in 1995, and within a year, Atria merged with Pure Software to form Pure Atria. Even though Hastings was supposed to become the Chief Technology Officer, he left the board and company.</p><h2 id=the-netflix-phenomenon>The Netflix Phenomenon</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The idea of Netflix reportedly came to Reed Hastings when he was charged a $40 late fee for returning <i>Apollo 13</i> six weeks late. The Blockbuster rental service was more expensive than a gym membership which helped him realize the potential to offer rented DVDs for a discounted rate. As DVD Players were a common media channel during the early 1990s, Hastings wanted to create a service that could send movies through the mail for viewing purposes. Along with Marc Randolph, who was a part of Pure Atria Software, the duo co-founded Netflix in 1998. Netflix allowed customers to rent a DVD for a week and return it through courier. Their subscription plan was developed and offered monthly rental options after some time.</p><p>As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, before Hastings became the sole CEO of Netflix, Randolph had also secured the position but left the company in 2002. It had 239,000 subscribers during its first year, and the success led it to become public in 2002. Interestingly, two years before going public, Reed had approached the CEO of Blockbuster, John Antioco, to buy Netflix for $50 million. However, Antioco laughed it off as a joke. By 2003, Marc Randolph had left Netflix, and a year later, the company generated an $80 million profit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dominating-the-ott-platform>Dominating The OTT Platform</h2><p>Reed Hastings had always been eager to introduce an online streaming platform for Netflix and incorporated the word ‘net’ from the internet in its name. He awaited declining DVD sales and launched its streaming content service in 2007. With a $5.99 monthly plan, Netflix ran its trial in Canada before expanding. The growing use of streaming services led Blockbuster to file for bankruptcy in 2010. In 2012, Hastings also ventured into production and created original series for the platform. One of its first and most notable television shows was <i>House of Cards</i>, <a href=#>which aired on Netflix</a> in 2013. With over 56 Emmy nominations, the series has won seven in total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hastings expanded its streaming services to 190 countries and created original content in various genres that have been loved by people everywhere. In 2020, he brought co-CEO Ted Sarandos on board to manage the board and content production. 2021 was a big year for Netflix as it surpassed 200 million subscribers for the first time since its inception, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. Despite the company's $5.8 billion net worth, Hastings takes a drastic pay cut with a salary of just $650,000. He makes the rest from his stock and compensation, which is more than $31 million yearly.</p><p>Reed Hastings dealt with the software but found the need to bring innovation to the DVD and streaming platform services. Netflix remains one of the most popular sites in the world, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch their favorite shows. From offering a $50 million buyout to Blockbuster to reaching a $5.8 billion net worth, Netflix keeps soaring yearly.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Shakira And 9 Other Celebrities That Were Convicted Of Tax Evasion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prHTZqmenZRitaK%2F06KloKtdqbWmecGio6Whn6Ouqr7EZp2orZ6ZsrN5wKebZpufYrCmu4yonWamlamzrbXXaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-highest-grossing-lady-gaga-movies-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Highest-Grossing Lady Gaga Movies, Ranked">&larr;
