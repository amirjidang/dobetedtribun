While their fathers paved the way for them, Freddie was a teen idol that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> and has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dad goals</a> for many. Kiefer, meanwhile, rose to prominence in the 80s in films like </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Lost Boys</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400> and blossomed into a powerhouse on the small screen.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>For a brief period in time, these two men worked alongside each other on the series </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, but Freddie had less than stellar remarks to say about Kiefer, alleging that he was prepared to quit acting altogether. Actors normally keep quiet about this sort of thing, so Freddie’s honesty caught people by surprise.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what in the world caused Freddie to almost quit acting? Let’s take a look at what happened!</span></p><h2 id=24-brings-them-together>24 Brings Them Together</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Freddie Prinze Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland are not a typical Hollywood pairing, but the amazing thing about the industry is that people will get to watch the best in the world hold it down with unexpected allies. This is precisely what happened when Freddie and Kiefer finally worked together.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was a massive hit when it was on the small screen in its prime, and Kiefer Sutherland was the star of the show. As the show was moving along, the powers that be were interested in adding to the cast, and according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>IMDb</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Freddie Prinze Jr. was added to the show in its 8th season, appearing in every episode.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Freddie would only take part on one season of the acclaimed series, but given the nature of the show and its popularity, his time was memorable, to say the least.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Normally, when an actor leaves a show, they tend to have positive things to say about their experience. They choose their words carefully, refraining from stirring the pot and burning any bridges that they might have made during that time. As the world would soon find out, Freddie was in absolutely no mood to be cool about things.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Once Freddie opened up about his time on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, people quickly learned that his time on set was anything less than fun.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities With Insane Guitar Collections</a></span></p><h2 id=freddie-s-bad-experience-on-set>Freddie’s Bad Experience On Set</h2><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was rolling along just fine with and without Freddie Prinze Jr., and after his time on the series, he would open up about his experience, particularly his time with Kiefer Sutherland. Turns out, Freddie isn’t a huge fan of the performer.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>In an interview with </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>ABC News</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Prinze would say, “I did '24,' it was terrible. I hated every moment of it. Kiefer was the most unprofessional dude in the world. That's not me talking trash, I'd say it to his face, I think everyone that's worked with him has said that."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>These were exceptionally harsh words from Prinze, who was clearly not a fan of Sutherland or the way that he handles his business on set. What Prinze said next truly shocked people.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He would say, “I just wanted to quit the business after that. So, I just sort of stopped."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That’s right, Freddie legitimately wanted to quit acting because of his time with Kiefer Sutherland.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, you might be wondering if this is a recurring theme with Kiefer’s other co-stars, but the truth is that others have been quite open about how great he is.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fellow </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Lombardi, would say</a>, </span><span style=font-weight:400>"My experience with Kiefer was absolutely the opposite. He was one of the most professional actors I've ever worked with. He wanted the best out of everybody. I have nothing but great experiences with him. He's a gentleman."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Freddie’s words carried a significant amount of weight to them, but he seemed to be in the minority here. Of course, people wanted to see if Prinze would actually retire from the business.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Left Hollywood To Work Normal Jobs</a></span></p><h2 id=where-is-he-now>Where Is He Now?</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>After using some harsh words to describe his time with Kiefer Sutherland, the fans had to wait and see if Freddie would retire from acting. He had been in the business for so long, and in truth, he had nothing left to accomplish.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thankfully, Freddie has continued acting, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>IMDb</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. While he was noticeably absent for a few years, Prinze has since gone on to appear in projects like </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bones, Star Wars Rebels</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bordertown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kiefer Sutherland, meanwhile, has done a ton of work since </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> came to an end. His most recent series, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Fugitive</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, just began its initial run, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>IMDb</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and we will see if it comes close to being as big as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>24</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things You Didn’t Know About Kiefer Sutherland</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Freddie Prinze Jr. legitimately stepped away from acting for a few years after his time with Kiefer Sutherland, and we cannot imagine them working together again.
