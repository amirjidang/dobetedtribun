Not only are the two longtime co-hosts of The Stern Show, but they have a deep, authentic, and platonic love for one another that's unmatched. But that doesn't mean that Howard and Robin don't fight. In fact, <a href=#>Howard and Robin absolutely do fight</a>. And it's usually about how the two of them conduct themselves in the world. While Robin has lots of complaints about Howard, we're focusing on what he's said about her... Mainly that she's a "snob" and a "narcissist".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Howard is far from the only Stern Show staffer who thinks Robin is too cool for school. The likes of Ronnie 'The Limo Driver' Mund, producer Gary 'Ba Ba Booey' Dell'Abate, and Fred Norris have all gone after Robin for some of her behavior. It's The Howard Stern Show, so in-fighting is part of the job description. But that doesn't mean there's no truth to it. Here's why Howard (and the rest of the staff) think Robin Quivers is a "snob"...</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-changed-her-name-to-39-robin-ophelia-quivers-39><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Robin Quivers Changed Her Name To 'Robin Ophelia Quivers'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You might be getting carried away with yourself. You just might be," Howard said to Robin after she announced on-air that she was to be referred to as "Robin Ophelia Quivers" instead of just "Robin Quivers". She claimed she did this because "people with three names are usually seen as more intelligent [and] more credible."</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-39-expensive-taste-in-wine><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Robin Quivers' Expensive Taste In Wine</span></h2><p>Robin Quivers<a href=#> foisting multiple $800 bottles of wine onto Howard's bill at a staff event</a> in 2009 is one of the most famous Stern Show fights in the history of the radio program. While Robin blamed the mix-up on the waiter (and on Howard who didn't ask what the price was), she also stated that she purposefully avoided wines on the list that were upwards of $1200. This is what started the ongoing topic of Robin becoming a wine snob who refuses to drink an inexpensive bottle. The debate was revived in 2020 when Robin took part in a virtual wine tasting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-quivers-bought-a-yacht><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Robin Quivers Bought A Yacht</span></h2><p>In 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin listed her canal-front mansion</a> on Long Beach Island. It's presumed that her yacht went with it as this is where she kept it. Howard was shocked that his co-host would splurge on such a thing since she has never shown an affinity for the water. While he thought she was acting "snobby" by purchasing it. After taking boating lessons, Robin invited the entire Stern Show staff to her house to go for a ride. Although she hired a captain to help out, presumably so she could enjoy in some beverages with her colleagues.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern Kept Robin Quivers Alive, According To Her</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-quivers-bought-a-pet-horse><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Robin Quivers Bought A Pet Horse</span></h2><p>A yacht isn't the only extravagant purchase that Robin and made. Although Robin has been open about her love of horses so when she purchased Blaze it wasn't that much of a surprise. Still, the fact that she kept Blaze in an over-the-top horse facility in Manhattan (yes, in the city), triggered a lot of teasing. But the way Robin kept Blaze "presentable" caused Howard and the rest of the staff to tease her even harder. Howard also knew Robin wouldn't keep the horse for long... Low and behold, he was right.</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-39-relationship-with-simone-dinnerstein><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Robin Quivers' Relationship With Simone Dinnerstein</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No friendship has landed Robin in so much on-air controversy as the one she has with classical pianist Simone Dinnerstein. Not only does Howard not understand why Robin likes the genre of music, but he thinks she's trying to be someone she's not when she talks about liking "the Goldberg Variations" and what not. Robin has hosted various in-person and virtual fundraisers with her musician friend and every time it's caused Howard to tease her.</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-lasted-only-one-day-in-india><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Robin Quivers Lasted Only One Day In India</span></h2><p>Robin wanted to be adventurous by flying to India for a vacation. But she hated it so much that she flew all the way back to America after just one day. This caused Howard to tease her about having tastes far higher than that of the common man or woman but failing to see it until it's too late.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-quivers-was-a-diva-about-recording-her-parody-songs><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Robin Quivers Was A Diva About Recording Her Parody Songs</span></h2><p>Robin Quivers singing on The Stern Show is an audience favorite. While she has conflicting feelings about this, due to being ridiculed for her voice, Robin is mostly game to play along. But when she started to receive notes on her recordings from her colleagues, she flat-out refused to work.</p><h2 id=what-robin-quivers-did-in-peru><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Robin Quivers Did In Peru</span></h2><p>Robin went all out in Peru. She hiked to Machu Pichu, tasted local cuisine, and even hired her very own Shaman to administer Ayahuasca. After her "authentically Peruvian" experiences, she, of course, went back to her fancy hotel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-quivers-was-late-to-her-book-signing-which-howard-thinks-is-egotistic><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Robin Quivers Was Late To Her Book Signing Which Howard Thinks Is Egotistic</span></h2><p>Robin walked off-air when Howard, Fred, Gary, and Jackie Martling teased her about being late for her very own book signing. They believed that Robin was valuing her own time over her fans. This criticism falls in line with comments about Robin constantly forgetting her keycard at work, making Ronnie go down and get her. As well as the ongoing argument that Robin never responding to texts or emails.</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-has-a-giant-self-portrait-in-her-house><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Robin Quivers Has A Giant Self-Portrait In Her House</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robin always defends the fact that she has a life-sized portrait of herself hanging in her dining room in her New York City apartment. While Robin says that it was a gift and that she feels she has to hang it out of respect, Howard and the staffers believe she secretly loves seeing herself looking so regal.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern Really Felt About Bob Saget</a></span></p><h2 id=robin-quivers-barely-socializes-with-the-stern-show-staff><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Robin Quivers Barely Socializes With The Stern Show Staff</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, Howard rarely socializes with his won staff either. Although, he's barely socialized with anyone since the pandemic began. But even before that, he has been maintaining some distance from his employees off the air. This is mostly because the man has become more of a recluse. But there was a time when Howard would partake in some staff functions. Robin too had her moments when she would go out with the guys. Ronnie Mund often brings this up on the show. Robin's separation from the rest of the staff occurred earlier than Howard's. We know this because Howard once gave her crap for not showing up to Gary's dinner party.</p><h2 id=robin-quivers-scored-the-highest-on-the-narcissism-test-and-it-sums-up-howard-39-s-thoughts><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Robin Quivers Scored The Highest On The Narcissism Test And It Sums Up Howard's Thoughts</span></h2><p>Robin being deemed "the biggest narcissist" on the Stern Show after everyone took a test angered her. But when Dr. Drew came on to claim that Robin was "the biggest narcissist" he's ever diagnosed, Robin was absolutely furious. Howard used the opportunity to not only create great radio by provoking her more, but also by using it at an explanation for her expensive taste in wine, how she caused her interns to quit, and her general demeanor. "I love her, she's a doll, but she's a tremendous narcissist," Howard stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To All of Howard Stern's Ex-Staffers?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadloqSvqrqMqqyirpWnwG6%2FzaiZZpyZqL22wMRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./improve-roi-business-upgrades-new-year.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Improve Your ROI with Business Upgrades in the New Year">&larr;
