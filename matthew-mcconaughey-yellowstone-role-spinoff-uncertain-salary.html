The Wolf of Wall Street star considers himself the key to the success of the upcoming show, tentatively titled 2024.</p><p>“Matthew and his team know he's the number one creative choice for the post-Kevin version of Yellowstone that's being planned,” said an insider. However, the series producers seemed reluctant to sign off the Interstellar actor as they couldn't afford the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$2.5 million per episode asking price.</a></p><p>In the following, we take a look at possible reasons why Matthew McConaughey hasn't officially been signed to the Yellowstone spinoff and how this has affected his career.

The Dallas Buyers Club actor has struggled with creative and monetary differences since he was first linked to the show.</p><p>“Paramount is dragging its feet on his $2.5 million per episode asking price — and there's a real possibility Matthew will just move on,” revealed a source, according to Life & Style.<strong><a href=#> Kevin Costner </a></strong>was paid $500,000 an episode in Season 1, but by the time Season 5 started, he was making around $1.3 million per episode.</p><p>“The expectation was that once the Hollywood strikes ended, sealing the deal would be a quick process but they're really dragging their feet on meeting his demands!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not just Matthew McConaughey who is allegedly having salary issues with the upcoming spinoff. Kelly Reilly (Beth Dutton), Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler), and Luke Grimes (Kayce Dutton) were all in dispute too. The trio, who appear in Yellowstone, weren't originally considered for the spinoff but have a pay-or-play clause in their contract for the now canceled season 6. It's believed showrunner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taylor Sheridan wants to add them to the upcoming show</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_did-kevin-costner-leave-yellowstone-because-of-his-now-ex-wife-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Kevin Costner Leave Yellowstone Because Of His Now Ex-Wife?">Did Kevin Costner Leave Yellowstone Because Of His Now Ex-Wife?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While Kevin Costner has had issues with Yellowstone and Paramount executives, Christine Baumgartner did not force him to quit the show.</p><p>A recent report revealed that Reilly’s agents were requesting $1.5 million per episode before dropping the figure to $1.2 million, and Hauser asked for $1.25 million an episode (a huge jump from his current $700,000 salary). The pair also reportedly want to be in first position on the call sheet, above McConaughey and his rumored co-star Michelle Pfeiffer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They feel they’re worth much more than that, especially since their characters are being used to set up the spinoff, and believe the powers that be are being stingy,” says the insider.

His demands may be sky-high, but he feels he's worth it — and the powers that be better get their act together, or he'll be saying adios, amigos!” an<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> insider revealed to the National Enquirer</a>, indicating the movie star is unlikely to back down on his demand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Life & Style source opened up more about the behind-the-scene problems.</p><p>“No deal Matthew has ever made has taken this long, especially after he won an Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club ."</p><p>"But Yellowstone is a monolith unto itself, and producers are wondering if it's worth it.”</p><p>Alongside monetary issues,<strong> Matthew McConaughey has also struggled with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">creative differences with showrunner Taylor Sheridan</a></strong>. According to insiders, the actor will only agree to take part in the spin-off series if he sees the script first.</p><p>“Matthew wants to be a part of the franchise, he’s a big fan, but he wants to flesh out his character more and has other ideas of his own to pass along.

However, it has been revealed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">it could take place in the modern day</a> and will<strong> serve as the next phase of the story of the Duttons and their ranch.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Variety spoke to a source “with knowledge of the series” who shared that the <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">upcoming show will be called 2024 </a></strong>and will feature “new cast members and locations,” while also including “some crossover characters” from the original flagship show.</p><p><strong>Kelly Reilly (Beth Dutton), Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler), and Luke Grimes (Kayce Dutton) are expected to return in some capacity.</strong> Don't expect to see John Dutton return as Kevin Costner; he had a major falling out with Taylor Sheridan and walked away from the show two seasons before his contract ended.</p><p>It has been widely reported that Matthew McConaughey and Michelle Pfeiffer are joining the Duttonverse, but it seems like the scripts need to be finalized before anyone new commits to the upcoming Yellowstone spinoff.</p><p>Taylor Sheridan had previously described<strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">McConaughey as "a natural fit" for his successful TV universe</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We had a few conversations over the years, and spitballed a few ideas.
