He helped his mother to find her biological parents and relatives.</p><p>Knowing her convicted mother is not her biological mother gave Theresa some sort of comfort. His grandma was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment.</p><p>In 2019 only, Theresa came to know about Stella and took a breath of relief. Not only did she find out the truth but got the chance to reunite with her biological parents in New Orleans.</p><p>Tyler found out his ability after seeing his grandmother’s death. He was then only 10 years old. He takes his ability as his gift and utilizes it to help people around different places.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=fans-know-tyler-henry-mother-theresa-but-who-is-his-father></span>Fans Know Tyler Henry Mother Theresa But Who Is His Father?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Tyler Henry’s mother is Theresa, who is well known to the fans as of now, even after she appeared in the show.

Tyler introduces him to audiences who don’t know much about him as the person having the ability to connect with the otherworldly.</p><p>It is strange how people ignore alive ones. But when someone leaves the world, they tend to seek many questions from them and wish to reunite at least once so he or she can put up many questions.</p><p>Tyler on the other hand heads out across the country to offer readings to as many of the people on his waiting list as he can, bringing them the hope, healing, and closure they are seeking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6uLXToWStsZyav260xKepsmWXp66vsMyaZKyslaG5onnPnqappJVirrOxjJysq6GfqsBuw8itn2agmah6rrvToZyrq12owbC%2B2Gamn2WknbJussCmoKWxXaWutMCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-kathy-hiltons-life-was-like-before-rhobh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Kathy Hilton's Life Was Like Before RHOBH">&larr;
