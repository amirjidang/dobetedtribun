These couples have 90 days to marry each other, and the show is about how they handle their 90 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a></strong> has seen many couples come and go on the series, and some are definitely more memorable than others. Everyone who watches the TLC show knows Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi. They are probably the most tumultuous pair the show has ever seen.</p><p>They constantly fight and make up, and then fight again. Many think that Angela bullies Michael because she often yells at him and tries to push him around. She has quite a personality and is not shy to say what she thinks and feels. Michael tends to be a little more laid back, but he often stands up for himself when he needs to.</p><p>It looks like their relationship may be over, but an official break-up has not been announced</p><h2 id=how-did-michael-and-angela-end-up-on-39-90-day-fianc-eacute-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Did Michael And Angela End Up On '90 Day Fiancé'?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angela and Michael met on social media in 2017. They spoke regularly and soon fell in love. There is a significant age difference between them, as Angela is more than 20 years older than Michael.</p><p>Angela planned to fly to Nigeria to meet her boyfriend in person, but her family and friends were skeptical. They believed he was scamming her, and wanted to use her to get a visa. She went to Nigeria anyway and the couple confirmed their feelings for each other.</p><p>It was Angela who reached out to 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, after seeing season one. Michael was against the idea at first, but warmed up to the idea after the show responded to Angela.They first appeared on season two.</p><h2 id=the-baby-issue-between-michael-and-angela><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Baby Issue Between Michael And Angela</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The constant issue in the TLC couple's relationship was having a baby. Michael wanted a child, but Angela's age made that quite difficult. He also explained how important having a child is to his Nigerian culture.</p><p>They came up with the idea of a surrogate carrying the baby, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they asked Angela's daughter, Skyla, to carry the baby</a> (or "tote" the baby, as Angela says) for them. Sklyla was adamant that no, she will not do this. Her mom kept after her for quite some time before finally giving up.</p><p>Michael's Aunt Lydia suggested that Michael have more than one wife so that he could have a baby, but there was no way Angela would even consider that idea.</p><h2 id=90-day-fiance-39-s-angela-39-s-bad-temper><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>90 Day Fiance's Angela's Bad Temper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the biggest problems this couple has faced is Angela's temper. She flies off the handle very quickly, and <a href=#>Michael is usually the target of her anger</a>.</p><p>She tends to storm off quite often. She once stormed away from friends of Michael's only because they were women, which she did not like. She also stormed out of a club because Michael looked at another woman. And there was more than one reunion where she left the stage in a rage.</p><p>But the biggest tantrum had to be at the 2021 reunion show. In yet another argument with Aunt Lydia, Angela got so mad that she pulled her top down and flashed Lydia, as well as the cameras, all while screaming, "Suck on these brand new f**king t*tties, b**ch. How do you like that s**t now?" Doesn't get much worse than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-90-day-fiance-39-s-angela-deem-and-michael-ilesanmi-get-married><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Did 90 Day Fiance's Angela Deem And Michael Ilesanmi Get Married?</span></h2><p>Angela and Michael officially tied the knot on January 27, 2020 in Nigeria. It was broadcast on TLC later that year.</p><p>Angela's dream was to be married in the U.S. but Michael's K-1 visa was denied, so being married in Nigeria gave them the opportunity to apply for a spousal visa. The couple looked very much in love as they said their vows and Angela even teared up during the ceremony. Typical Angela had a hard time saying the word "obey", but she reluctantly mumbled it.</p><p>Angela came back to her home in Hazelhurst, Georgia not long after the wedding. Michael stayed in Nigeria awaiting his visa.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are '90 Day Fiancé' Stars Yara And Jovi Millionaires?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=90-day-fiance-39-s-angela-gets-weight-loss-and-other-surgeries><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>90 Day Fiance's Angela Gets Weight-Loss And Other Surgeries</span></h2><p>While Angela was in Nigeria for her wedding, she noticed she was putting on weight, and she was worrying about her health - never mind the constant cigarette in her hand. <a href=#>The TLC star decided to have weight loss surgery.</a> "There's benefits behind doing it for myself because it also benefits the grandkids being around me longer and [Michael] and I being together longer," she explained. "I did it for myself to stay alive … and [to] benefit the ones I love."</p><p>She ended up having liposuction, a gastric sleeve, and a breast reduction. After that, she had a face lift and a breast lift. Then, teeth implants, which she shared on 90 Day Diaries. The 56-year-old has lost over 90 pounds, and she is very happy with the changes she made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé’s Emily Bieberly’s Weight Loss Journey, Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=how-90-day-fiance-39-s-michael-ilesanmi-felt-about-angela-39-s-surgeries><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How 90 Day Fiance's Michael Ilesanmi Felt About Angela's Surgeries</span></h2><p>Angela and Michael had problems from the start. From differences in cultures, to Angela's jealousy, to the baby problem, the couple seemed to be constantly fighting. But the surgeries felt like the beginning of the end.</p><p>Michael has always been very vocal about his love for Angela's breasts. <a href=#>As soon as Angela mentioned the surgeries to her husband, he was against them all</a>, but especially the breast reduction. Although he did admit a fear of losing his wife, "I think it's possible that Angela is doing all of this surgery just to move on, to look sexy, attractive and look younger, because she's tired of waiting for me and she can move on and find somebody else," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angela went ahead with the surgeries anyway but felt no support from her husband, which upset her. She even felt he ghosted her before she went into surgery. Angela said, "But you need somebody, you know, your partner [to be] emotionally supportive. It was rough. I feel like I was in it alone."</p><h2 id=did-angela-and-michael-break-up-during-the-90-day-fiance-tell-all><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Angela And Michael Break Up During The 90 Day Fiance Tell-All?</span></h2><p>The surgery was a problem for Michael, and Angela flirting with Dr. Obeng did not help matters.</p><p>At the 2021 Tell-All, Michael mentioned that his wife left her doctor's party in his car. He then did not defend her during her argument with Aunt Lydia on camera. That was too much for Angela and sh proclaimed that she was "done". As she stormed off the set, she yelled, "I'm in my hot little outfit. I'm going out. And I'm going to get some f**cking attention. And I'm gonna get some good attention."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, the couple seemed to kiss and make up. They began appearing on each other's social media and sent loving messages.</p><p>Things got weird when Michael began hanging out with another 90 Day Fiancé cast member, Usman Umar a.k.a. Sojaboy. Usman and Angela attacked one another and Angela blocked him and her husband on Instagram. Definitely trouble in paradise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>​​​​​​​The Truth About 90-Day Fiance's Chantel Everett And Pedro Jimeno Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=have-angela-and-michael-been-cheating><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Have Angela And Michael Been Cheating?</span></h2><p>There are plenty of rumors that both Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi are cheating. It appears that might be true at the start of the current season of 90 Day Fiancé:Happily Ever After?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angela has never trusted Michael, and she always believed he would cheat on her. Now Angela is questioning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what she believes is shady behavior</a> from her husband. Not only is she worried about other women, she also is starting to think that he was using her all along for money and a way to get a visa.</p><p>"This is why I feel like maybe he's scamming me because all he do[es] is rub his salt into an open damn wound and that's not the Michael I fell in love with, and I can't trust him," she said in a confession.</p><p>But Angela doesn't appear to be innocent either. There have been rumors that she had an affair with Dr. Obeng. And, in a recent episode of the TLC show, Angela is seen face timing with a man who definitely was not her husband. He is Bill Sotiropoulos, a man she has been doing virtual TikTok dances with. She and the former stripper seem to be quite cozy. She referred to him as "sexy baby".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time may truly be the end for Angela and Michael.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xmp5Zirq%2BzxKWYZpyVmrpurc2dZKahk52upriMoqOeq5Gjuqp5zqdkcmhdma66ecWimKeblWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2021-a-closer-look-at-emily-jendrisak-gavin-mcinnes-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Closer Look At Emily Jendrisak, Gavin Mcinnes Wife">&larr;
