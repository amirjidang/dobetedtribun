It turned a host of women from NeNe Leakes, Kim Zolciak and Sheree Whitfield into globally recognized stars. Later came iconic ladies like Porsha Williams, Kandi Burruss, Phaedra Parks and Kenya Moore. All of which came with their own drama, their own relationships and their own feuds!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans instantly fell in love with their big personalities, dramatic looks and fighting. The Atlanta housewives are never one to hold back their feelings, but fans love the many feuds these women have with each other.</p><p>Here are some of the best feuds from The Real Housewives of Atlanta which led to physical fights, hair pulling and even housewives being fired from the reality show!</p><h2 id=porsha-williams-vs-kenya-moore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Porsha Williams VS. Kenya Moore</span></h2><p>These two were part of one of the most memorable of the RHOA fights for fans, the feud featuring Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore is a fan-favorite. Porsha and Kenya got off to a rocky start during season 5 after Porsha referred to the former Miss USA as Miss America, but it soon got worse. Fans of the show still disagree to this day as to whether Williams or Moore was to blame for the beatdown. During the season 6 reunion, Moore accused Williams of cheating on former husband Kordell Stewart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike other feuds, this one got physical as Williams started pulling Moore's hair and hitting her. “I can’t believe I did that! I have embarrassed myself!” Williams screamed to the other housewives.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's How Much 'RHOA' Star Porsha Williams Is Worth">Here's How Much 'RHOA' Star Porsha Williams Is Worth</a></span></p><p>Kenya then tried to demand that Porsha be fired from the reality TV show. Moore and Williams struggled to agree during reunions with the pair fighting on various reunion shows. "You're a horrible friend with your fake receipts," Williams said about Moore during the 2020 reunion.</p><p>Moore accused Williams of "trying to get a storyline for next year." And Williams shot back, "Even when I wasn't a housewife, honey, I had more scenes than you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phaedra-parks-vs-kandi-burruss><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Phaedra Parks VS. Kandi Burruss</span></h2><p>The housewives' feud began in Season 8, when Phaedra Parks accused Kandi Burruss of not supporting her during her divorce. They later sparred during the Season 9 reunion when Porsha Williams revealed a rumor about Parks.</p><p>Parks had apparently shared a rumor involving <a href=#>Burress and her husband, Todd Tucker,</a> planning to drug Williams and take advantage of her. "I was shocked, angry, disgusted ... I could go on," later wrote about the rumor. "Even with everything that had happened between me and Phaedra, I still didn't think Phaedra would go so low as to tell someone that I wanted to drug them. "</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="RHOA' Cast Not A Fan Of Kandi Burruss' 'Kandi And The Gang' For These Reasons">RHOA' Cast Not A Fan Of Kandi Burruss' 'Kandi And The Gang' For These Reasons</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Parks was fired from the show for spreading malicious false claims about Burruss. "The question that we look at now with Phaedra is, when the reunion ended, none of the other women wanted to have anything to do with her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Cohen told E! News.</a></p><p>"How do you shoot a show about a group of friends when no one is speaking to one of the friends?" Burruss expressed during an appearance on Watch What Happens in relation to making up with Parks "Nah," she replied. "Absolutely not. Come on now ... That was too far, that was too much. I've never heard anything, no apologies, no nothing."</p><h2 id=nene-leakes-vs-kim-zolciak><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>NeNe Leakes VS. Kim Zolciak</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak have never had the closest relationship and frequently trade insults. <a href=#>Leakes is even suing Zolciak for her racially inappropriate comments</a>. The duo started Season 1 as pals, but once word got out that Zolciak's then-boyfriend was still married to another woman, their relationship changed.</p><p>During the first reunion, Leakes had no problem telling Zolciak-Biermann to "close your legs to married men." The two continued to argue and feud over Twitter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's How The Cast Of 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' Feel About NeNe Leakes And Her Rumored Return">Here's How The Cast Of 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' Feel About NeNe Leakes And Her Rumored Return</a></span></p><p>In 2009, NeNe Leakes released a memoir full of stories about her past and present. In the book, she described her co-star in an unkind light. "Kim wouldn't know how to make a dime if you slapped her with a bucket of change. Every dollar that chick has is somebody else's husband's money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most violent moments of their long-lasting feud was not caught on camera but was discussed extensively on the Bravo show. Zolciak claimed that Leakes tried to “choke her out.” Sheree Whitfield later referred to the incident as not a catfight, but a dogfight.</p><h2 id=mama-joyce-vs-carmon-cambrice><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mama Joyce VS. Carmon Cambrice</span></h2><p>Mama Joyce and Carmon Cambrice have never been the closest of friends, but things got heated between the two at Kandi Burruss’ wedding dress fitting. Burruss' mother very publicly went on a rampage against Kandi’s engagement to Todd. In her mind, Kandi's assistant Carmon was creeping with Todd behind Kandi’s back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She told everyone what she thought while holding a shoe in her hand. Joyce accused Carmon, a longtime Burruss friend, of getting Kandi's "leftovers," including Todd.</p><h2 id=sheree-whitfield-vs-nene-leakes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sheree Whitfield VS. NeNe Leakes</span></h2><p>In the series premiere of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, NeNe Leakes showed up at Sheree's birthday bash, "eyes poppin', lips bustin'," only to discover she wasn't on the party guest list. What followed was a meltdown on Whitfield's driveway. Many believe this franchise was born from this moment. For a while they looked like friends, but in Season 12 Sheree has had some unkind words about NeNe.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheree,told Hollywood Life, after the explosive season 12 reunion</a> "I think she’s very calculated. She has a huge following. It may get people thinking. I don’t know."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-wu-hartwell-vs-kim-zolciak><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lisa Wu Hartwell VS. Kim Zolciak</span></h2><p>Another first season feud, the reunion focused on Hartwell and Zolciak. Dr. Lisa diagnosed Kim as a cancer-free habitual liar who needed a medical intervention. Lisa then offered to flip Kim over the couch in the hope of knocking sense into her.</p><p>In 2008, Hartwell accused Zolciak of making false comments suggesting she was a drug addict which was why she “didn’t have kids,” which insulted both her and her children. At the time, Zolciak denied the claim.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hartwell told Us Weekly that she believed Zolciak was feuding with her for the cameras</a>. "I thought she was a fun girl and fun to hang out with…then she just started on me, maybe for the cameras,"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cynthia-bailey-vs-porsha-williams><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Cynthia Bailey VS. Porsha Williams</span></h2><p>Things between Cynthia Bailey and Porsha Williams became violent in Season 8. A fun boat day organized by Kenya Moore ended up going wrong after Bailey took offense to Williams calling her a b****. Moore planned the event after Bailey was going through marital issues with her now ex-husband Peter Thomas.</p><p>Williams tried to apologize but it was too late. Insults were thrown between the two women and at one point, Williams stood on top of Bailey. Bailey responded by kicking Williams off of her. Williams ended up needing to be restrained by several security guards before being escorted off the boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At a cast lunch, the women made up and later admitted during the season 8 reunion that things were blown out of proportion. Bailey admitted she had too many drinks and that her anger was misplaced.</p><h2 id=sheree-whitfield-vs-kim-zolciak><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sheree Whitfield VS. Kim Zolciak</span></h2><p>During Season 2 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Sheree pulled Kim’s wig off while they were in the middle of an argument. “I felt the need to tug on her wig,” Sheree explained during the 2009 episode. “I did not try to pull it off. I did not want to pull it off. I just wanted to shift it a little bit.”</p><p>The pair later became friends, teaming up over their dislike of NeNe Leakes.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Why NeNe Leakes Is Suing 'Real Housewives'">Why NeNe Leakes Is Suing 'Real Housewives'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsCixYytn56rlWKus7GMrZ%2BeZZKetKix0q1kq52RoXqpu9SsnLChpprAbrvFZpitpJGjwaJ5xZ6snatf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gary-garland-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Garland Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
