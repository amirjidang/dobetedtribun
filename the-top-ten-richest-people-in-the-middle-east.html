After all, oil and gas are abundant in the region, thereby allowing its owners to purchase the most expensive gadgets, the most rare exotic car, and just about any costly toy that catches their fancy. And they have got it made until practically the next generation, as their current reserves are enough to last them for the next several decades even if no new oil field is discovered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But who exactly are the people who have earned the most money?

Khoury has also not been averse to working with other big building companies, as proven when he collaborated with the Bechtel Group, the largest construction company in the world. The collaboration was for a contract Khoury signed with the Iraq Petroleum Company for the construction of oil pipe storage facilities. In addition, Khoury is widely known for his fervent assistance to the Palestinian cause in its struggle against Israel. He was actually born in Palestine before it became a Jewish state. He then moved to Beirut after they got driven out of their home, and got his first job as a construction worker helping build the airport in Tripoli in Lebanon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWLBsLyMrZynZaKesKmx0q1kqZ2fpbmmecinZK2glWK6qrDDpZxmnZGowXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./these-are-the-biggest-hits-highest-grossing-songs-of-hip-hop-legend-tupac-shakur.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Are The Biggest Hits (Highest-Grossing Songs) Of Hip-Hop Legend Tupac Shakur">&larr;
