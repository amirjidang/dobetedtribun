That is perhaps inevitable for a show that has been on air for 18 seasons, 400 episodes and almost two decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most recently confirmed departure of sorts will be Ellen Pompeo, who has been <a href=#>a fixture of the show since the beginning</a>. The actress plays Dr. Meredith Grey, a role she has portrayed in every single episode of the show since it made its debut on ABC in March 2005. Pompeo is not intended to leave Grey’s completely and will instead take on a much more reduced role starting the upcoming Season 19. <a href=#>The 52-year-old will also continue acting elsewhere</a>, as she pursues other opportunities.</p><p>The industry path beyond the Shonda Rhimes medical drama is one that is very well trodden, with very high profile names often leaving the show throughout the years. Among those whose departure was most acutely felt by fans, this is what they have been up to since.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Ellen Pompeo Almost Pass On 'Grey's Anatomy'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-chambers-played-hollywood-legend-marlon-brando><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Justin Chambers Played Hollywood Legend Marlon Brando</span></h2><p>There aren’t many characters in the history of Grey’s Anatomy who can lay claim to the kind of adoration that Justin Chambers received from fans as Dr. Alex Karev. He left the show after 341 episodes, with his final appearance airing in March 2020.</p><p><a href=#>Chambers returned to the small screen</a> this year, playing The Godfather star Marlon Brando in a miniseries titled The Offer on Paramount+.</p><h2 id=patrick-dempsey-went-into-motor-racing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Patrick Dempsey Went Into Motor Racing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patrick Dempsey was very much a fan favorite in his role as Dr. Derek Shepherd in the first 11 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy. He returned in a recurring capacity for Season 17 between 2020 and 2021.</p><p>Before that, Dempsey had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">invested more time and effort into motor racing</a>, which originally began as a hobby. He has also continued acting, as well as pursuing a myriad of business interests.</p><h2 id=t-r-knight-has-become-a-familiar-face-on-television><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>T.R. Knight Has Become A Familiar Face On Television</span></h2><p>In the overall context of how long Grey’s has been on air, <a href=#>T.R. Knight’s time on the show</a> was relatively short. He played Dr. George O’Malley for 103 episodes, including one guest appearance in 2020.</p><p>In the years since his original departure, Knight has played roles in TV shows such as The Good Wife, The Flight Attendant and the anthology series Genius on National Geographic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Stars Katherine Heigl And T.R. Knight Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=sandra-oh-has-been-making-waves-on-killing-eve><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sandra Oh Has Been Making Waves On Killing Eve</span></h2><p>It is always a risk leaving a major role in a show as big as Grey’s Anatomy. For Sandra Oh, however, it appears that <a href=#>her exit was eventually worth it</a>.</p><p>Not only has she managed to improve her mental <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and physical health</a>, she has also been making waves on BBC’s spy thriller drama, Killing Eve. Dr. Cristina Yang from Grey’s is now an M15 analyst by the name Eve Polastri.</p><h2 id=jesse-williams-is-pivoting-towards-movies><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jesse Williams Is Pivoting Towards Movies</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jesse Williams returned for the Season 18 finale of Grey’s in May, having exited the show last year in order to “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">escape his comfort zone</a>.”</p><p>Williams’ two biggest projects since have been big screen productions: Secret Headquarters was released recently on Paramount+, while rom-com Your Place or Mine is currently in production.</p><h2 id=eric-dane-is-one-of-the-stars-on-euphoria><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Eric Dane Is One Of The Stars On Euphoria</span></h2><p>Eric Dane <a href=#>does not have very good things to say</a> about his spell in Grey’s, despite how crucial his character was. That is despite the fact that he returned as a guest star in 2021.</p><p>Dane officially left the show in 2012, after which he starred in The Last Ship on TNT. He is currently playing the villainous Cal Jacobs in HBO’s Euphoria.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Euphoria': The Truth Behind Eric Dane’s Controversial Scene</a></span></p><h2 id=sara-ramirez-starred-in-madam-secretary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sara Ramirez Starred In Madam Secretary</span></h2><p>Sara Ramirez’s character in Grey’s Anatomy was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not always loved by people</a>, but she probably had more good than bad traits overall. Dr. Callie Torres was originally a recurring character before Ramirez was then promoted to the main cast.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, the actor featured in 36 episodes of Madam Secretary on CBS. They played a character called Kat Sandoval.</p><h2 id=kim-raver-returned-to-24-and-then-to-grey-rsquo-s-anatomy-again><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kim Raver Returned To 24, And Then To Grey’s Anatomy Again</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About two years before stepping into the shoes of Dr. Teddy Altman on Grey’s, Kim Raver had wrapped up a 52-episode run on Fox’s 24. Her tenure in the medical drama lasted two seasons, before she initially left in 2012.</p><p>Raver reprised the role of Audrey Raines in 24: Live Another Day in 2014. Three years later, she made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her triumphant return to Grey Sloan Memorial</a>.</p><h2 id=chyler-leigh-became-sentinel-in-the-arrowverse><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chyler Leigh Became Sentinel In The Arrowverse</span></h2><p>Chyler Leigh and Eric Dane’s tragic exits from Grey’s Anatomy are some of the saddest of all characters to ever leave the show. Since that final bow as Dr. Lexie Grey in 2012, <a href=#>the actress has done a lot of television work</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notably, she is now Alex Danvers / Sentinel in various Arrowverse shows, including Supergirl, Arrow, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiuoyfmK%2Bnop7BpnnGq5yyq12Wu6LAzqawZquklr%2B0ecearZ5llKS7pnnSoqWcnV2ptaa10WacsaGkYq6tsddmopqqlat6rbHXopxmn6KaxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-football-coaches-2011.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Highest Paid Football Managers 2011 - Richest Football Coaches">&larr;
