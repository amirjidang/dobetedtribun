It was inevitable since a decade or so ago in its infancy, it was just a source of research material, a luxury for most. Now it has become more than that. A lot more. Not only has it been a major source of entertainment, the use of the internet has evolved into a way of life, almost a necessity even.</p><p>We wake up and the first thing we do is check our phone. We check our mail, check our news feed. The use of the internet has intertwined with our lives. As with any source of entertainment, stars will be born.</p><p>Enter Lele Pons, internet personality and one of the most famous, if not most famous person in the now defunct video platform Vine. Despite being known primarily as a quirky comedian, the Venezuelan persona is also known for her goddess like beauty and great fashion sense.</p><p>Considering the nature of her videos, it’s no surprise that Lele Pons is a free spirited lass. Being quirky, one could think that Lele Pons is the type of girl who doesn’t care about her looks. Far from it, she’s a lady through and through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boyish attitude aside, Lele is known to sport curvy cocktail designer dresses and comfortable everyday clothes with such charm we can’t stop looking at her.</p><p>Her comfort in her own skin allows her to&nbsp;wear outfits with confidence. Lele Pons is known to rock any outfit and give it a style of her own.</p><h2 id=monochromatic-but-still-fantastic>Monochromatic But Still Fantastic</h2><p>Going with just a single shade of color for an entire ensemble can be a risky move. If you don’t get it right, you’ll be blander than a dish prepped by a person trying to cut back on salt. But if you pull it off, boy does it pay off.</p><p>Lele evidently knows how to make an outfit work. When you look this stunning, sometimes it’s best to pick a more subdued color and let your face do the talking.</p><p>Do a flirty hair pose for the camera and you’re done. It also helps that Lele has taken a liking for wearing thigh high boots and heels which adds another level of&nbsp;sophistication&nbsp;to any wardrobe.</p><p>Lele sure knows how to wear a monochromatic attire while keeping her and our lives colorful!</p><h2 id=plaid-is-not-a-fad>Plaid Is Not A Fad</h2><p>A fall season garment staple, the plaid or tartan print is one of the most common yet challenging</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>clothing patterns to pull off.</p><p>It may be considered as an art form to mix and match clothes and proper accessories that will complement this pattern style because you seriously would not want to be mistaken as a picnic table.</p><p>As we can see Lele Pons in the picture, this Venezuelan digital star clearly does not, in any way, resemble a table cloth. What she definitely looks like is someone who came to join the picnic in her gorgeous and fashionable style.</p><p>She brings flair and glamour to the simple outdoor event. Donning a full plaid printed dress paired with a thigh high boots, Lele Pons will surely turn heads to any picnic that she attends to. She rocks this look so much that one may wonder, is there anything Lele Pons can’t wear?</p><h2 id=mixing-it-up>Mixing It Up</h2><p>The good thing about women’s fashion is that there’s a lot to choose from. Halter top, tube top, off- shoulder, backless, there’s no shortage of women’s garments. There’s an infinite gamut that the ladies wardrobe has to offer. Not only that, ladies can also play mix and match with the different colors that she can see in her closet and makeup kit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Such is the case with Lele Pons in this photo. The Vine comedian turned social media celebrity may have chosen to wear a simple makeup by just highlighting her lips with a fierce red shade, but it doesn’t stop her from looking A-list when paired with her eye-catching yellow off-shoulder blouse and silky trousers.</p><p>Not a lot of people can survive such an attire, but this is Lele Pons and she has a talent for making her outfit work for her!</p><h2 id=comfy-but-chic>Comfy But&nbsp;Chic</h2><p>Wearing just a plain off shoulder top and loose fitting sweat pants, this girl still dazzles everyone with her pretty looks.</p><p>Lele Pons can be seen at home just chilling on the floor taking a selfie. The online queen does love taking selfies of her wearing different outfits and considering her extensive wardrobe, you can bet your bottom dollar, that phone is riddled with pictures of it.</p><p>With her seemingly busy schedule, it’s nice that she’s able to take a break and just have some me time. But as can be evidenced from the photo, a long black dress can be seen hanging from the background, possibly an outfit for a girls’ night out later on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We don’t know about you but we much prefer the one she’s already wearing in the picture.</p><h2 id=making-women-s-tennis-look-beautiful>Making Women’s Tennis&nbsp;Look Beautiful&nbsp;</h2><p>Wearing a red halter top, with a full skater skirt, Lele Pons radiates beauty with that smile on her face. This seemingly tennis player inspired outfit is perfect for the summer when the heat can be overwhelming.</p><p>However, one has to be extra careful when looking at Lele during the summer. Otherwise, you just might end up being rushed to the emergency room due to heatstroke.</p><p>As much as we love ogling the Venezuelan goddess, we’re not sure if she’s worth taking a trip to the doctor’s office. Hence, proceed with caution and ogle at your own risk.</p><p>Lele Pons’ bubbly personality matches well with this cute outfit. Fun loving and carefree, she’s ready for anything the rest of the day has to offer.</p><p>It is also a testament to Lele’s adventurous personality. We’re quite sure that it is not only sports attires that Lele can pull off with ease.</p><h2 id=retro-swimwear>Retro Swimwear</h2><p>Retro, high waisted bikinis are making a comeback. The spandex style of clothing was common in the early days; be it in the gym for a workout or at the beach for a day out in the sun. Fast forward to today and it has seen a revival in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her soft, smooth skin and gorgeous blonde hair, Lele Pons does justice to this retro look. The Venezuelan beauty has a face that is timeless, maybe that’s why this nostalgic look works so well on her, or maybe if you have a body as shapely as hers, anything would look good on you. We don’t know what’s more striking, that&nbsp;red bikini or her skin glistening under the sun.</p><h2 id=cruising-out-in-the-sun>Cruising Out in the Sun</h2><p>From a bikini clad model look straight to being all covered up, Lele still works her magic for everyone to feast on.</p><p>This is proof that Lele Pons does not need to wear a two piece bikini to look nice. The Venezuelan online star still looks gorgeous wearing just denim long sleeves.</p><p>You know you’re hot when you aren’t showing much skin at all, but can still draw every man’s eye on to you. There’s no better way to soak up the sun than on a speedboat on a day out with your friends.</p><p>We’re so used to women wearing two piece bikinis which cover next to nothing while out by the water, that it’s a fresh sight to see Lele Pons all covered up but still looking sensual under the sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=good-morning-charlie>Good Morning Charlie</h2><p>Charlie’s Angels, both the original tv series and the film adaptation were popular for both the male and female viewers. The female audience appreciated the concept because it was empowering to women all around the world. The male audience, however, more or less tuned in because of the eye candy.</p><p>Though not devoid of scanty attires, the movie adaptation’s signature look is of black pants matched with a black top to convey a stealthy spy vibe. The movie which starred Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu featured many a stunt that’s why they were required to wear something more functional.</p><p>They struck a perfect balance of menacing mercenary and seductive spy in that tight fitting all black wardrobe. With that chopper in the background, Lele looks like she’s ready to fight baddies but ready to dazzle men’s hearts as well.</p><h2 id=designer-denim-diva>Designer Denim Diva</h2><p>Fun fact: Jeans are pants made from denim or dungee cloth and was believed to be first made for miners during the Gold Rush era by Levi Strauss and his tailor friend Jacob Davis. It wasn’t until the 1930’s that women were able to wear and enjoy a pair of pants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the years, the use of denim has expanded and evolved that it’s no longer used just for making pants but it has also been used to make other types of garments as well such as jackets, skirts and shorts among other things. This is because denim has an undeniably classic and rugged look.</p><p>As seen in the picture, Lele Pons is captured wearing a denim long coat paired with thigh high denim peep toe high heeled boots. Denim clothes are no longer confined in the notion of being a workman’s clothes. Style icons like Lele Pons, is a clear testament that denim clothes can be fun and functional at the same time, all the time.</p><h2 id=simple-but-stunning>Simple But&nbsp;Stunning</h2><p>If you’ve got it, flaunt it. That’s what they all say. And with a body like Lele, why wouldn’t she?</p><p>Lele Pons has the abs every girl desires to have. Clearly the time she spends at the gym has paid off.&nbsp;In this picture, though she’s all covered up, one can’t look away from her amazing abs. The look stays classy but still shouts, “I’m a woman.” This look is great just about anywhere you go. For a quick run to the mall or off to grab a cup of coffee, this outfit is comfy yet one can’t deny that it’s still a headturner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A handkerchief is a must have though because she’ll need it to wipe the drool off of men’s faces that sets eyes on her.</p><h2 id=ready-casual-but-real-classy>Ready Casual But Real Classy</h2><p>Like many of Lele Pon’s outfits, she makes sure she never goes over the top (unless for comedic effect, of course).</p><p>With a myriad of garments at her disposal, it’s impressive she doesn’t go overboard with styles and accessories. Most of the time, less is more.</p><p>Take this photo as an example. Armed with just oversized black sunnies, long blonde tresses, a brown V-neck dress, and a matching fur lined coat, Lele Pons is a vision to behold.</p><p>She may have chosen to wear just the basics for a quick trip around town, but she is definitely oozing class wherever she goes.</p><p>Ladies and gents, take this lesson to heart; there is truth in the saying that,</p><p>Simplicity is beauty.” Just look at Lele Pons if you don’t believe us.</p><h2 id=working-the-runway>Working The Runway</h2><p>In February of 2016, Lele Pons was one of the models of the American Hearts Association’s Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection. The event is catered to increase awareness about the dangers of heart disease and stroke in women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the hope of further increasing awareness towards the public, the event organizers decided on choosing Internet personalities as their models. Lele Pons being a Vine star, it’s no surprise that she graced the said event’s catwalk.</p><p>Being a part of the event shows that it’s not all jokes and antics for the popular online comedian. It’s nice to know that she has a serious side as well as a caring side.</p><p>Lele knows when it’s time to turn off the comedy, and focus on what’s really important, and that’s health. Whatever the occasion, Lele brings her A-game and hypnotizes the crowd in this mesmerizing red dress.</p><h2 id=ready-for-the-club>Ready For&nbsp;The Club</h2><p>From a scenic stroll at the beach wearing a swimsuit to a flirty fashion show donning a regal red dress, we’ve seen Lele Pons has a wide range in the clothing and styling department.</p><p>Here we see her wearing a fun black top with high waisted bottoms. She’s ready for a night of dancing and drinking. Lele Pons can also be seen without her trademark beach waves. Instead, the blonde beauty is sporting a shorter and sleeker do, which we definitely love!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Lele certainly has everything planned out for her night out since even her phone case matches her clubbing attire perfectly! Don’t act surprised when you see Lele with a long line of guys following her at the bar for a chance to dance and get to know her.</p><p>Chic is the game and Lele has it all the same.</p><h2 id=hotness-overload-in-oversized-shirt>Hotness Overload In Oversized Shirt</h2><p>They said that women who are beautiful can still look stunning even if they wear just a burlap sack, or in this case an oversized shirt.</p><p>Women usually stay away from baggy clothes as it simply does not flatter anyone’s body. Unfortunately for most women, oversized clothes could make any woman who wears it frumpy and very unfashionable.</p><p>That is why women generally only allow themselves to wear oversized and baggy shirts as something to sleep in.</p><p>But clearly with Lele Pons, this oversized baggy shirt can be an opportunity to showcase to her social media followers that lounging at home does not mean you can’t stay gorgeous. With her effortless beauty and her shades as her only accessory, this Covergirl brand ambassador, stood in front of a mirror to strike a figure flattering pose and to snap a photo to prove to everyone that even at home, she is still a stunningly beautiful woman with or without an audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pulling-the-britney-schoolgirl-outfit>Pulling The Britney Schoolgirl Outfit</h2><p>Remember Britney Spears’ first music video? Yes, we’re talking about “Baby One More Time”. The music was a hit for the female crowd and she became an idol, while it was popular among the male audience as well because of the pop icon’s signature schoolgirl outfit.</p><p>Every boy has dreamt of going to a school where the ladies wear skimpy skirts and an open blouse. Not really within school regulation, is it?</p><p>Schoolgirl outfits are a common go to theme during Halloween and on costume play. What a lonely world it would be for guys if these events did not exist.</p><p>Wearing a white tank top with a plaid short skirt, accessorised with a backpack to complete the look, Lele Pons gives homage to one of Britney’s most famous looks. Don’t tell Britney this but in our opinion, Lele Pons has her beat in her own game with this one.</p><h2 id=bringing-back-baywatch>Bringing Back Baywatch</h2><p>Baywatch was a big hit in the 90’s. The story was compelling; A bunch of lifeguards sworn to keep people’s lives safe from the normal perils of beach life to more elaborate crime organization lurking in the city. Many would say they watched it for the plot, but a lot less would care to admit they saw it for the babes wearing those tight suits at the beach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ask anyone what comes to mind when you mention red swimsuit at the beach and they’ll immediately answer “Baywatch”. The red one piece swimwear has become iconic for the hit show of the 90’s.</p><p>Lele Pons is owning this outfit with her long wavy hair and curvy physique. Who knows? Maybe if they decide to do a remake of the tv series with a lighter tone, they could probably cast Lele Pons in it.</p><h2 id=frozen-hotness>Frozen Hotness</h2><p>If the Disney movie Frozen wasn’t catered for the younger audience and more for the adults, then this is what it would look like. Lele Pons can be seen dawning a sultry aquamarine bathing suit, which is almost the same color as the gown worn by Princess Elsa.</p><p>However, instead of the seemingly cold personality that the young princess has, Lele Pons smiles seductively at the camera as if she has a secret that only she knows about. Not only that, the Vine celebrity definitely brings the heat on whenever she’s clad in a swimsuit. Watch out, Olaf! Don’t go anywhere near Lele Pons or you’ll soon be a puddle of melted ice!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It might be safe to say that some, if not most, women would love to be Lele Pons right now. I know I’d love to be able to make men’s hearts melt like Lele Pons does.</p><h2 id=proud-heritage>Proud Heritage</h2><p>Lele Pons wears a colorful bikini top with a simple but fabulous red shorts in a social gathering. Though not surprising, it’s interesting to note that like most of her photos, Lele always carries a big smile on her face and it’s not a smile just for the camera either. Her face really exudes with genuine joy.</p><p>What’s really noteworthy in this picture is the fact that she’s carrying a Venezuelan flag. Considering her continued rise in popularity, it’s nice to know that Lele Pons can stay grounded and be proud of her heritage.</p><p>Many a person who turn to showbiz eventually get bigger heads and forget who they truly are. Lele clearly isn’t the type.</p><p>All she is, is an exuberant individual who has the ability to pass on the joy she feels to other people thru her work.</p><h2 id=cuddly-christmas>Cuddly Christmas</h2><p>The Yuletide is the time for giving, the time for family reunions. It’s also the perfect time to wear red garments and knitted sweaters while enjoying a hot cup of cocoa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most people would have a hard time pulling it off, looking like pre-adolescent teens who are forced to dress up as the relatives come to visit, Lele Pons looks perfect in this outfit. She gives the outfit a beautiful touch with the stunning high boots.</p><p>The only downside to such an outfit is she certainly isn’t getting a present from good old Saint Nick for looking too naughty. That’s not too bad a pitfall when she knows every man would want her as their present instead.</p><p>If you ask us, she doesn’t need that drink she’s holding because she’s plenty hot as she is.</p><h2 id=generic-gym-wear-don-t-jive>Generic Gym Wear Don’t Jive</h2><p>Living healthy is big nowadays. An active lifestyle coupled with proper eating habits is all the right now. What better way to stay healthy than hitting the gym? There has been a boom in gym membership because everyone is health-conscious now. Many people do crossfit training, a little muay thai on the side, yoga, and let’s not forget the tried and tested pumping the iron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whatever you fancy for your workout session, we live in an era where fashion has creeped up to any activity we do. Gym life is no exception and it’s bigger than ever. Who says you can’t look good while you burn those calories away? Yoga pants, leggings, dri-fit tank tops, and sports bras are some of the most popular sports garments that have transitioned from just workout clothes to a fashion statement.</p><p>One look at Lele Pons and you know she hits the gym on a regular basis. The social media star is every bit as beautiful despite being all sweaty from a strenuous workout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6qrnAoJysZaSdrrV5z6umr51dobKtsYyppqerXZ7AbsDHnmSqrZWau267xWaroZ1dnru1sdGnnK1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-of-charlize-therons-boyfriends-ranked-by-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All Of Charlize Theron's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth">&larr;
