So anybody he took up with was going to have a tough time. Then in August of 2014 stories of a budding romance between the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twilight</a>&nbsp;star and quirky singer FKA Twigs began circulating. Some applauded. Others were worried.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First of all, the romance seemed to move at breakneck speed. Pattinson's friends and family were concerned. By December of 2014, he reportedly had bought her a ring. Oh dear his fans said and began attacking Twigs online.</p><p>But the couple seemed to thrive until the summer of 2017 when cheating rumors emerged. A few months later, it was all over. Some were delighted. Others threw their hands up in despair.</p><p>It was, in some ways, a strange pairing. But when it was good, it was very, very good. And then things turned sour. Here come 15 things we know about the relationship between R-Patz and FKA Twigs.</p><h2 id=sienna-miller-introduced-them><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Sienna Miller Introduced Them</span></h2><p>Sienna Miller and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pattinson </a>have been friends (and friends with benefits?) for ages. Sienna had a feeling R-Patz might go for the quirky FKA Twigs. So she took the plunge and introduced them. Little did she know what she had started. It was like a whirlwind from day one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=august-2014-first-official-sighting><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>August 2014: First Official Sighting</span></h2><p>Early on in their relationship, Pattinson and FKA Twigs were first spotted together in New York City. It was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">August of 2014 </a>and already the two were acting like a couple. There was just this easy rapport between the two. It was a million miles away from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen Stewart</a>. They actually smiled at one another!</p><h2 id=they-moved-ahead-really-really-fast><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Moved Ahead Really, Really Fast</span></h2><p>By September they were holding hands on Venice Beach in California. A few months later he showed up at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her concerts with flowers</a>. They were clearly besotted. Things were moving so fast that the media was in a frenzy. That's when the love birds tried to keep things private. Tried being the operative word.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Movies Robert Pattinson Ruined (And 10 He Saved)</a></span></p><h2 id=rob-s-friends-warned-him-to-slow-down><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Rob's Friends Warned Him To Slow Down</span></h2><p>R-Patz had friends who knew him well. They knew that he tended to go overboard and overdo things when he first got into a relationship. They took one look at the way things were going with FKA Twigs and they told him to slow down. Hey, they said, you might just be scaring the poor girl off with this whirlwind romance. There was even talk of an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">elopement</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=december-2014---that-ring><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>December 2014 - That Ring</span></h2><p>Did he take his friends' good advice? No way, said Robert Pattinson. There was no elopement, but by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">December there was a ring</a>. Was it just a promise ring as Pattinson said. Or was it a full-blown engagement ring. They kept the whole thing private and didn't show the ring off for a while. But things were moving forward.&nbsp; She even met his family.</p><h2 id=great-chemistry-with-a-bit-of-goofiness><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Great Chemistry With A Bit Of Goofiness</span></h2><p>The thing was that they just seemed to have such a good time together. They smiled and smiled and smiled. She beamed up at him and he beamed down at her. And they joke around. They both seemed really happy. Oh well, we hope they enjoyed it while it lasted. The road to romance was about to get a little bumpy for the happy couple.</p><h2 id=t-pain-spilled-the-beans><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>T-Pain Spilled The Beans</span></h2><p>It's April of 2015. Big mouthed rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Pain spilled the beans</a> and told&nbsp;Vulture that "ol' Patty and Twigs are engaged!" It came out in the magazine's April 1st edition. T-Pain must have gotten some grief because he then says it was all an April Fools' joke. Too late T-Pain. Just don't expect an invite to the wedding!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=racist-attacks-nastiness-on-social-media><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Racist Attacks: Nastiness On Social Media</span></h2><p>Apparently some of Pattinson's fans were not so pleased about the thing with FKA Twigs. Many wanted him to get back with Kristen Stewart. Like don't hold your breath on that one. Anyway, FKA was subjected to racist abuse and comments on social media. She pushed back hard. But the damage was done. Apparently, she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very, very upset.</a></p><h2 id=his-family-didn-t-like-her><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Family Didn't Like Her</span></h2><p>When they first met her, Pattinson's family<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> liked FKA Twigs</a>. Not as much as they like Kristen Stewart, but they thought she was okay. Then they got a look at videos of her stage shows. Raunchy was the word used. They turned against her. They wanted R-Patz married but to a nice, traditional, conservative girl. So why did the like K-Stew?</p><h2 id=his-friends-gold-digger-warning><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Friends: Gold Digger Warning</span></h2><p>Later in 2015 the same friends who had warned Pattinson to slow down to avoid scaring FKA off were watching how things were going and began to suspect that she was just a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gold digger</a>. Rob seemed to be spending a lot of money on Twigs, from presents to expensive vacations. Watch out his friends said. Did he listen? No way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bought-a-house-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bought A House Together?</span></h2><p>The rumor mills were swirling around the couple when a few gossip sites reported that they were buying a house together. The most that can be confirmed beyond any doubt was that in November of 2014 Pattinson plonked down more than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 million for a house</a> in the Hollywood Hills. By that time, he and Twigs were "cohabiting".</p><h2 id=those-rumors-about-r-patz-and-katy-perry><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Those Rumors About R-Patz And Katy Perry</span></h2><p>Fact: Katy Perry and Rober Pattinson are long-time friends. While he was with Twigs, did it slip over into "friends with benefits"? Some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gossip sites said yes</a>&nbsp;that it happened over the summer of 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others said no. Just to clear the air, Perry, Pattinson, and Twigs were snapped having dinner together. Perry is the only one with a smile on her face.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Most Heartwarming Pics Of Katy Perry's And Orlando Blooms Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=those-rumors-about-twigs-and-the-male-model><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Those Rumors About Twigs And The Male Model</span></h2><p>At about the same time as gossip sites were linking Katy Perry and R-Patz, FKA Twigs was snapped snuggling, holding hand with, and generally enjoying the company of a dishy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">male model</a> while on a vacay in Ibiza. Was this revenge for the Katy Perry thing or what? It was August of 2017 and things were definitely not looking good.</p><h2 id=october-2017-r-patz-calls-it-quits><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>October 2017: R-Patz Calls It Quits</span></h2><p>Between Katy Perry, male models, and relationship fatigue, it was clear by September of 2017 that the couple was headed for a split. Pattinson himself ended it in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">October of 2017.</a> Reportedly that's when Twigs moved out of the house they shared. Some said she kept the ring, causing some to remain hopeful of a reconciliation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Rumors Robert Pattinson Wishes Would Quietly Go Away</a></span></p><h2 id=twigs-unmeshes-and-feels-more-alive><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Twigs "Unmeshes" And Feels More Alive</span></h2><p>Celebrity is all about putting the right spin on bad news. And FKA Twigs' public take on the split was that she was "unmeshing" herself from Pattinson and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling more alive,</a> discovering who she really was. She was reportedly getting to know herself better after living in Pattinson's shadow. Well, that's better than ranting and raving and crying, isn't it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Strange (But True) Facts About Robert Pattinson</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJqVp8FuvMCtq6Kmo6S7brLKmmStr5mcwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnZqbpKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ron-reagan-wife-is-ron-reagan-married-to-doria-palmieri.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ron Reagan Wife: Is Ron Reagan Married To Doria Palmieri?">&larr;
