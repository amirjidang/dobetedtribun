I’d buy all of the new versions just to prove a point."</p><p>Taylor took Kelly's advice to heart and by the time August rolled around, Taylor announced to Good Morning America that she plans to re-record her earlier albums.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scooter-braun-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast-forward to November 14, 2019, Taylor Swift wrote a heartfelt Tumblr post titled "Don't know what else to do." This time, Taylor directed her grievances at Scooter and Scott yet again, accusing them of preventing her from performing her classic hits at the AMAs, where she was set to be honored with the prestigious Artist of the Decade award.</p><p>But Taylor was far from backing down. Big Machine Records then released a statement, countering Taylor's side of the story. Meanwhile, Scooter finally broke his silence with a now-deleted Instagram post, labeling the entire situation a "miscommunication" at its core.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has Scooter Braun Actually Been Able To Move On Since Getting Divorced From Yael Cohen?</a></span></p><p>A few months later, Taylor lashed out at Big Machine's because they intended to release an aged performance of hers as a live album.
