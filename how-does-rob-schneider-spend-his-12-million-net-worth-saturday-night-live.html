Gradually, he transitioned from writing to featuring as a full cast member on the show. On SNL, Schneider played different roles at different times but his most memorable character was Richard Laymer who was a fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Rob Schneider Turned Down This Adam Sandler Film</a></span></p><p>However, despite being best known for Saturday Night Live, Schneider has appeared in several other television shows and films. With his incredible work, this comic actor continues to make a name for himself across the entertainment industry. And while at it, he has also made a lot of money. Schneider is currently estimated to be worth about $12 million. But with his seemingly busy schedule, how does he spend all of this money? You’re about to find out.</p><h2 id=baseball-cards><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Baseball Cards</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schneider is an avid baseball card collector and has a passion for collecting cards from the 1950s and 1960s. The talented actor and comedian collects rare baseball cards such as a 1951 Willie Mays baseball card estimated at $175,000 and many more similarly expensive cards.</p><h2 id=expensive-jewelry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Expensive Jewelry</span></h2><p>In addition to his love for baseball cards, Schneider apparently also enjoys splurging on expensive jewelry. The ace director proposed to <a href=#>his current wife Patricia Azarcoya Arce</a> with a diamond engagement ring worth thousands of dollars. Rob reportedly also spends a lot of money updating his watch collection which is filled with Cartier pieces.</p><h2 id=luxury-houses><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Luxury Houses</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob works hard for his money so it is no surprise that he enjoys spending it just as much. The actor often invests in luxury properties which he ends up selling at a profit. In 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob put his San Francisco French Normandy-style manor home up for sale at $3.6 million</a>. He reportedly bought the property for a little over $1.9 million. In 2004 he sold his former LA home for $1.09 million. To date, Rob continues to buy luxurious properties and enjoys the high-end features they provide.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Rob Schneider's Relationship With His Daughter Elle King</a></span></p><h2 id=luxury-cars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Luxury Cars</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many celebrities, Rob also has a love for <a href=#>luxury cars</a> and this is evident with his car collection. The comedian reportedly owns a convertible 2-seater sports car with state-of-the-art technology, a carbon fiber interior, and luxury leather seats. From his Instagram, it's not hard to see that this is one of Rob’s favorite cars. In addition to the convertible, the actor is also a proud owner of a silver Porsche Carerra cabriolet identical to the one he drove in Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.</p><h2 id=private-weddings-and-honeymoon><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Private Weddings And Honeymoon</span></h2><p>In April 2011, Rob tied the knot (for the third time) with television producer Patricia Azarcoya Arce. Though a low-key ceremony, there is no doubt that a lot of money went into making the couple’s big day a success. Following their wedding, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob and Patricia went on a week-long honeymoon in Taiwan </a>where they had a taste of the local cuisines, dined at the famous Din Tai Fung restaurant in Taipei, and enjoyed the exquisite vibe at the Shilin Night Market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vacations><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Vacations</span></h2><p>All work and no break makes Rob a dull boy! The comic actor who doubles as a father to three lovely kids makes sure to take time off work and is no stranger to family vacations. The adorable family often make trips to different places around the world and keeps their fans updated on their fun moments via social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About David Spade And Rob Schneider's Falling Out</a></span></p><h2 id=clothes><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Clothes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob Schneider isn't your regular actor, and he doesn't do traditional clothes either. The renowned actor apparently has a love for vintage clothing and is the proud owner of a collection of Hawaiian shirts. With his outfits regularly taking us back to the ‘70s, we are almost convinced that Rob might be in the wrong style era.</p><h2 id=paintings><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paintings</span></h2><p>Rob loves paintings as much as he loves acting, and the comic actor has a treasured painting of Jack Lord of Hawaii Five-O (1968), which he first came across during a family vacation with his parents in Oahu when he was 8. Years later, he found the portrait in a vintage shop in San Francisco and bought it. Rob Schneider has a thing for vintage things, and he spends his money judiciously satisfying his desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birthdays-and-anniversaries><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Birthdays And Anniversaries</span></h2><p>With <a href=#>three children and a wife</a>, Rob undoubtedly spends a lot of money on his family. Special milestones like birthdays and anniversaries might even mean splurging more money. In addition to going all out to make his loved ones feel special on their big days, Rob warms hearts with social media tributes that leave fans raving.</p><p>At 57, Schneider is no doubt an accomplished entertainer in every sense of the word. And with how hard he has worked, it is only fitting that he spends his money on things that bring him true happiness.
