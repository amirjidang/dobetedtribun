In 2007, Gucci Mane founded 1017 Records, and he helped pioneer the hip-hop subgenre trap music, alongside fellow Atlanta-based rappers T.I. and Young Jeezy.</p><p>Gucci Mane started writing poetry as a child and began rapping at age 14. Mane released his debut album Trap House in 2005. Mane followed that up with Hard to Kill in 2006, then Trap-A-Thon, and Back to the Trap House in 2007.</p><p>Mane served a six-month jail term for assault in late 2005 and during that time was also charged with murder, but the charges eventually dropped.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mane Life After Prison</h2><p>Mane served a year in prison for violating probation on his 2005 assault conviction. Mane released his second studio album, The State vs. Radric Davis in 2010. After Mane’s release from jail, he changed his label’s name from So Icey Entertainment to 1017 Brick Squad Records.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years Mane has guest-starred on remixes of the songs “Obsessed” by <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>, “Boom Boom Pow” by the Black Eyed Peas, and “5 Star Chick” by Yo Gotti.</p><p>In April 2017, Gucci performed at Coachella. He surprised the audience by bringing out P Diddy to perform with him in a memorable moment.</p><p>While in jail, Gucci Mane still kept his career alive and well and made great money. If he could continue working on his goals while incarcerated, there’s no reason why one shouldn’t be working daily.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gucci Mane Net Worth</h2><p>As of April 2022, Gucci Mane has a net worth of $14 million. His wealth is primarily from music sales, features, and tour dates. His record label, 1017 Records, has a vast roster of artists, which positively contributes to his net worth. Gucci Mane is one of Atlanta’s finest, and his impact and influence on trap culture are immeasurable.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gucci Mane Money Issues</h2><p>In November 2013, Gucci Mane filed a lawsuit against his former manager Debra Antney and her son, fellow rapper Waka Flocka Flame. Gucci claims Debra and Waka robbed him blind while he was their client in the lawsuit.</p><p>Gucci claims Debra stole jewelry and mismanaged his royalties and assets. Gucci told the court he was nearly broke with some serious IRS issues left to deal with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Has Gucci Mane Achieved Success</h2><p>He quickly released his first album La Flare, pressed the project onto 1000 CDs, and distributed them throughout East Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>After the release, inspired by renowned Master P, Davis created his record label, LaFlare Entertainment. Davis knew he was expanding, and handing out CDs was no longer productive. So, he took off to New York, searching for a distribution deal.</p><p>He returned home from his trip unsuccessful but continued to network in his hometown. He met label owner Big Cat, the head of Big Cat Records, and they began to work. Davis released singles Black Tee and So Icy featuring Young Jee with Big Cat by his side.</p><p>Both were successful, leading him to secure a distribution deal with Tommy Boy records. Davis turned his attention to creating his debut album with the agreement taken care of.</p><p>In 2005, he released Trap House as an independent artist and reached the top 20 on the Billboard R&B/ Hip Hop Album Charts. The lead single Freaky Gurl peaked at number 12 on the Hot Rap Tracks.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Warner Bros</h3><p>With Davis’s early success, record labels took notice, and he signed a deal with Warner Bros. He also gained respect from his peers and in 2009 had over 15 features from artists such as Mariah Carey, Black Eyed Peas, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>From 2007 to 2014 he released, Back to the Trap House, Murder Was the Case, The State vs. Radric Davis, The Appeal: Georgia’s Most Wanted and Return of East Atlanta Santa.</p><p>Unfortunately, he would run into trouble with the law and be incarcerated for carrying a concealed weapon, possession of marijuana, and disorderly conduct.</p><p>He was sentenced to 183 days in prison but continued to make music while incarcerated. He released 12 projects in jail in 2014 and made over a million dollars.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Atlantic Records</h3><p>Davis was released in May of 2016, came home with a new mindset and physique, and became more health-conscious. He picked up right where he left off, signed a new deal with Atlantic Records, and released the single First Day Out.</p><p>Under Atlantic Records, he released eight studio albums, Everybody Looking, The Return of Mr.Zone, Everybody Looking, The Return of East Atlanta Santa, Mr. Davis Evil Genius, Delusions of Grandeur, and Woptober. To this day, Davis is a part of the label and is set to release another album in 2022.</p><p>Gucci says he got his success from his hyper-productivity and risk-taking behavior. He has a reputation for being the trap rap industry’s unofficial A&R representative.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Highlights of Gucci Mane’s Career</h3><p>Here are some of the best highlights of Gucci Mane’s career:</p><ul><li>Trap House (2005)</li><li>Hard to Kill (2006)</li><li>Trap-A-Thon (2007)</li><li>Back to the Trap House (2007)</li><li>Murder Was the Case (2009)</li><li>The State vs Radric Davis (2009)</li><li>The Appeal: Georgia’s Most Wanted (2010)</li><li>The Return of Mr. Zone 6 (2011)</li><li>Everybody Looking (2016)</li><li>The Return of East Atlanta Santa (2016)</li><li>Mr. Davis (2017)</li><li>El Gato: The Human Glacier (2017)</li></ul><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCz1JyaomWdlrumec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./henry-cavills-dating-history-gina-carano-kaley-cuoco-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Henry Cavills Dating History: Gina Carano, Kaley Cuoco, More">&larr;
