When it comes to the technical aspect of it, the <a href=#>specialty of jazz music</a> was in improvising the pitch and timbre, and sometimes even breaking certain music norms to create special effects with polyphonic ensemble playing.</p><p>Every jazz legend has reached a glory point in their music career by improvising their art to create a new tradition within the ever-evolving genre. However, jazz is known to have its roots in blues and ragtime music.</p><p>Here are some of the richest jazz musicians of all time.</p><h2 id=ella-fitzgerald>Ella Fitzgerald</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When one thinks of Ella Fitzgerald, the first thing that comes to mind is the iconic duet performances by Louis Armstrong and Fitzgerald. But Ella single-handedly transcended the <a href=#>strict norms of jazz,</a> if there were any, and turned it into something else altogether.</p><p>Thus it does not come as a surprise when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JazzFuel </a>lists Ella Fitzgerald as one of the best jazz musicians of all time and one of the richest. She had a net worth equivalent to almost $10 million at the time of her death in 1996.</p><h2 id=louis-armstrong>Louis Armstrong</h2><p>Louis Armstrong is undoubtedly a legendary name when it comes to jazz music and is one of the most popular.

Armstrong is also considered by many to be among the immortals of jazz music.</p><h2 id=wynton-marsalis>Wynton Marsalis</h2><p>One important aspect of music is lyrics, as it works hand in hand to create the desired effect upon the listener's ears. <a href=#>Wynton Marsalis</a> is such a jazz artist who won over the audience with the power of lyrics.</p><p>The poetry behind jazz found expression in Marsalis’ works, and thus, his contribution to jazz is one of the most crucial.

He had an astounding net worth of about $19 million at his death in 1991.</p><h2 id=nat-king-cole>Nat King Cole</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nat King Cole or Nathaniel Adams Coles had become a household name when he launched some of his successful works, as stated by The Guardian.

He had an impressive net worth of about <a href=#>$27 million.</a></p><h2 id=kenny-g>Kenny G</h2><p>Other than the trumpet and the piano, another instrument closely associated with jazz music is the saxophone. The Jazz master who made a huge name as a jazz saxophonist is none other than <a href=#>Kenny G.</a></p><p>Kenneth Bruce Gorelick is one of the richest jazz musicians because he has a record of having made global sales of over 75 million records. Kenny G has a net worth of about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million</a>.</p><h2 id=frank-sinatra>Frank Sinatra</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Francis Albert Sinatra is one of the first names remembered when one talks about classic jazz music. He is credited with making timeless records like Fly Me to The Moon and My Way, which will always be a favorite.</p><p>Frank Sinatra passed away in 1998, but by then, he already had a jaw-dropping worth of over $250 million.

Along with Jerry Moss, he also established A&M Records.</p><p>Talking about the wealthiest and most well-known jazz musicians, a few other names that can be considered irreplaceable are Quincy Jone, who was worth over $400 million, and Tony Bennett, with a net worth of about $200 million. Back in the 20th-century, jazz was sensational, and many artists were active in the genre, but only a few of them stood out as legends and made big bucks out of it.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Music Videos Ever Made</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Waves</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DiscoverMusic</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JazzFuel</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3osbZsmSbnZGpwG6EjKugnKCVqMFutsCzsWalpai2pLXAp6po</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-epstein-net-worth-biography-wiki-age-parents-family-photos-or-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Epstein Net Worth, Biography, Wiki, Age, Parents, Family, photos or more">&larr;
