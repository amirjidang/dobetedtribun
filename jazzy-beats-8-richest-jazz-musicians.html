When it comes to the technical aspect of it, the <a href=#>specialty of jazz music</a> was in improvising the pitch and timbre, and sometimes even breaking certain music norms to create special effects with polyphonic ensemble playing.</p><p>Every jazz legend has reached a glory point in their music career by improvising their art to create a new tradition within the ever-evolving genre. However, jazz is known to have its roots in blues and ragtime music.</p><p>Here are some of the richest jazz musicians of all time.</p><h2 id=ella-fitzgerald>Ella Fitzgerald</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When one thinks of Ella Fitzgerald, the first thing that comes to mind is the iconic duet performances by Louis Armstrong and Fitzgerald. But Ella single-handedly transcended the <a href=#>strict norms of jazz,</a> if there were any, and turned it into something else altogether.</p><p>Thus it does not come as a surprise when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JazzFuel </a>lists Ella Fitzgerald as one of the best jazz musicians of all time and one of the richest.

Along with Jerry Moss, he also established A&M Records.</p><p>Talking about the wealthiest and most well-known jazz musicians, a few other names that can be considered irreplaceable are Quincy Jone, who was worth over $400 million, and Tony Bennett, with a net worth of about $200 million.
