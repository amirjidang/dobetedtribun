The main character, Kevin Arnold, is just a kid trying to grow up while figuring out the confusing world around him. The show also featured a sweet love story between Kevin and Winnie Cooper. Although <a href=#>Winnie and Kevin's relationship ends</a>, they learn a lot from each other.</p><p>Although star <a href=#>Fred Savage's net worth has increased</a> in the decades since The Wonder Years ended, he has been the subject of misconduct allegations that have shed light on what he is like to work with.

However, she has remained friends with him since <strong>The Wonder Years went off the air in 1993</strong>.

Saviano played Paul Pfeiffer, a pal of Kevin's. While the three characters got along well in the fictional world of The Wonder Years, the actors also seemed to keep in close contact with each other.</p><p>McKellar wrote in her Instagram caption:</p><p>"This group look familiar to anyone? got to see these guys for lunch yesterday — it was so much fun to catch up and hear how their beautiful families are doing! And yes, @joshsaviano, I totally agree — *you guys* are like family… I mean, we DID grow up together, after all.”</p><p>Several years earlier, in 2015, according to The Daily Mail, McKellar and Savage attended the TV Land Awards.

Later on, he actually wrote me a love letter in real life, and we wrote each other a couple letters. But then that was kind of it.
