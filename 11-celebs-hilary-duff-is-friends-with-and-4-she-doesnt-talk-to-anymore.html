She has worked with many celebrities over her almost 20-year career but tends to focus more on her personal life these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is now married with two children and tends to keep out of the spotlight unless she is promoting something or standing up for a good cause.</p><p>While most of the friends you see on her Instagram are not famous, Duff does have some celebrity friends. Being in the industry for so long, she has also lost touch with some celebrities she used to be pretty close with and worked with. A lot of her friends she has made through her sister, Haylie.</p><p>Not a lot is known about Duff's relationships with celebrities anymore, except for who she posts and interacts with on social media.</p><p>Here are 11 celebrities Hilary Duff is friends with and 4 she doesn't talk to anymore.</p><h2 id=friends---haylie-duff><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Friends - Haylie Duff</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her longest and most loyal friend is her sister, Haylie. The two were in the movie, "Materials Girls" together and have since become wives and moms. Haylie's kids were even in Hilary's second wedding and their children are very close. It's also good to be friends with your family members.</p><h2 id=friends---ashley-tisdale><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Friends - Ashley Tisdale</span></h2><p>The women know each other through Haylie and have become really close friends. Tisdale even attended Hilary's baby shower in 2018 before she gave birth to her daughter. The Disney Channel stars have bonded over their childhood roles and being married. Tisdale has frequent spa days with the sisters.</p><h2 id=friends---miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Friends - Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>Disney kids have to stick together! Duff and Cyrus have been friends since their teenage days and recently got back in touch with one another. Duff was on an episode of Cyrus' new Instagram show, "Bright Minded". Cyrus admitted that she wanted to be Lizzie McGuire growing up, after seeing her in concert at 11.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus And Hilary Duff Can't Stop Idolizing Each Other!&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=friends---molly-bernard><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Friends - Molly Bernard</span></h2><p>These two may just be BEST friends. The actresses met on the set of their show, Younger and have become very close. Bernard even officiated Duff and Matthew Koma's wedding. She is all over Duff's Instagram and Duff posted when she got engaged. It&nbsp;feels like they've been friends for years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Facts We Didn't Know About Hilary Duff's Show, Younger</a></span></p><h2 id=friends---alanna-masterson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Friends - Alanna Masterson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actresses have been best friends for 12 years. They even got matching tattoos in 2014. The tattoos are of ghosts with the words, 'ride or die', underneath. Duff has more tattoos than you think, but most of them are hidden. Masterson is one of the Masterson siblings. Her siblings are also actors, including her half-brother, Danny, who was on That '70s Show.</p><h2 id=friends---lizzie-mcguire-cast><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Friends - "Lizzie McGuire" Cast</span></h2><p>Ever since the Lizzie McGuire reboot was announced, Duff has reunited with her co-stars. For a while, the cast hadn't talked to each other because life got in the way, but the cast reunited a few years ago for bowling and they started getting close again. The new Lizzie McGuire reboot has been put on hold but maybe it'll happen one day in the not-too-distant future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Showing How Much Hilary Duff Has Changed Since "Lizzie McGuire'&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=friends---chris-mintz-plasse><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Friends -&nbsp;Chris Mintz-Plasse</span></h2><p>Duff knows the Superbad actor through her husband. Koma and Mintz-Plasse are best friends and are on a bowling team together called Bowling with the Beatles. Mintz-Plasse even officiated their wedding, along with Molly Bernard. Chris joked he was giving up his better half to Duff. What are best friends for?</p><h2 id=friends--mandy-moore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Friends- Mandy Moore</span></h2><p>The women have been pals for a while. Moore and her husband, Taylor Goldsmith,&nbsp; attended Duff's wedding in 2019. Goldsmith, who is in the band Dawes, played at the wedding reception. They first met at a Stand Up To Cancer event and have stayed in touch throughout the years.</p><h2 id=friends---jenna-dewan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Friends - Jenna Dewan</span></h2><p>The actresses know each other through Haylie Duff, and their children are good friends. The two posed together at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards Post-Party, where both look totally gorgeous. They bond over being mothers, so these actresses have a lot in common. They have both been through divorce and been in the spotlight for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends---meghan-trainor><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Friends - Meghan Trainor</span></h2><p>Meghan Trainor is a huge Lizzie McGuire fan. The pair were on an episode of "Quizzed", a segment on Billboard's YouTube channel, together. During the quiz, which Trainor aced, Duff brought out Clayton Synder, who played Ethan Craft on Lizzie McGuire. Let's just say this meeting was what fan's dreams are made of.</p><h2 id=friends---joanna-garcia-swisher><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Friends - JoAnna Garcia Swisher</span></h2><p>Along with Tisdale and a few other famous faces, Garcia-Swisher attended Hilary's baby shower in 2018 and is a part of her life. The friends also attended the Established Jewelry by Nikki Erwin Launch Party together in 2015. They even attended Lea Michele's engagement party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doesn-t-talk-to---aaron-carter><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Doesn't Talk To - Aaron Carter</span></h2><p>The pair dated in the early 2000s when they were 13 years old, and it did not end well. They first met when Carter appeared on an episode of Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;because she had a crush on the singer. Carter posted on Twitter a few years ago that he was going to try to win her back.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-talk-to---lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Doesn't Talk To - Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><p>Duff was in a love triangle with Lohan and Carter and it turned out to be one of the biggest feuds of the 2000s. Lohan was the reason that Duff and Carter broke up - he started dating her, as well as Duff. Lohan even called Chad Michael Murray, who they both co-starred with, and talked trash about Duff.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-talk-to---joel-madden><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Doesn't Talk To - Joel Madden</span></h2><p>The pair dated for a bit. She was 16 and he was 24, which is a big age difference. After breaking up with Madden, who is the lead singer of Good Charlotte, Duff did a friend cleanse and Madden didn't make the cut. Madden is currently married to Nicole Richie and has two children with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doesn-t-talk-to---frankie-muniz><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Doesn't Talk To - Frankie Muniz</span></h2><p>The actors starred in Agent Cody Banks together and had great chemistry. Reportedly, the co-stars dated for about two years before calling it quits. However, there is no bad blood between them. Muniz even tweeted a photo of a motorcycle that he rode to pick up Duff on their first date. The actors have just lost touch.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Duff Calls Out Millenials For Not Respecting Social-Distancing Rules</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoamWTmrmmrtJmn6KkkafGbrDUn51moaNis7O1xKebrGWnnsGpecCnm2ZsXai1pnnDqJyspqRiwaK4ymarqGWRo8auu9GeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-winter-dresses-for-january.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="17 Best Winter Dresses for January">&larr;
