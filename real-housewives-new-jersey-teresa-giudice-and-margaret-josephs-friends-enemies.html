The hit series first aired back in 2009 and made international headlines when fellow RHONJ legend, <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> flipped a table on former housewife, Danielle Staub. Talk about an iconic moment, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, as the cast officially wraps up the filming of season 12, there seems to be a lot of drama to unpack, and according to fellow housewife, Melissa Gorga, this season not only brings the drama but tops last season, and considering the tension last season brought, you know this upcoming one is going to be good!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think 'RHONJ' Star Teresa Giudice Is Getting Engaged</a></span></p><p>As seen in the past, Housewives friendships come and go, which fans witnessed with <a href=#>Margaret Joseph's feud with Danielle Staub</a>. Well, it seems as if Margaret is now feuding with another cast member, however this time it's with Teresa! So, what led to their falling out, and are the two still friends today? Let's get into it!</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-teresa-and-margaret>What Happened Between Teresa And Margaret?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Margaret Josephs first joined the series back in season 8 and has been stirring the pot ever since! When she first joined the group, it was clear that Josephs would get on great with just about everyone, however, that slowly but surely changed. The accessories designer went head-to-head with former housewife and friend of, Danielle Staub.</p><p>Their feud was one of the biggest witnessed in modern-day RHONJ, however it seems as if Margaret is now at odds with the OG herself, Teresa Giudice. The Jersey ladies have officially wrapped up with filming for season 12, and many sources claim that Margaret and Teresa aren't doing too hot.</p><p>Josephs, who doesn't shy away from speaking her mind, reportedly had a lot to say about Teresa and her new boyfriend, Louie Ruelas. This obviously didn't sit well with Tre. So, she allegedly exploded on Margaret during their cast trip to Nashville, Tennessee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teresa and Louie made things official last year, however, rumors were circulating regarding their romance months before. This all came about following Tre's divorce from ex-hubby, Joe Giudice. Well, the duo have made it clear that they are head over heels in love with one another, so why would Margaret try to hinder that?</p><p>Well, turns out Margaret has heard a few rumors regarding Louie and some shady business he's reportedly been involved in. While this is all speculative, Margaret decided to bring it up during the filming of the show, and Teresa let her have it! <strong>Fans were quick to point out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two do not follow one another</a> on Instagram anymore</strong>, pointing to the two not speaking at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHONJ': Everything We Know About Jackie Goldschneider</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-aydin-is-on-the-outs-too>Jennifer Aydin Is On The Outs, Too!</h2><p>As if going after the legendary Teresa Giudice wasn't enough, it appears as if Margaret Josephs had a nerve to pick with fellow castmate Jennifer Aydin, too! Jennifer and Teresa are notorious for being besties on the show, toss in Dolores Catania and you've got fans' favorite trio.</p><p>As the ladies filmed for months, it turns out that Josephs pulled out a rumor she had heard of Jennifer and her husband, Bill Aydin. According to a number of sources, a cheating scandal is set to come out, while we aren't entirely sure if Jennifer cheated, or Bill, it's become evident that something happened prior to Jen and Bill having kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering this was never discussed with their five children, Jennifer and Margaret are also at odds now, however these two have been at it for seasons now! As Margaret hurled the rumor during filming, Jennifer allegedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threw her drink in Josephs's face,</a> which is the type of drama that Jersey is definitely used to seeing.</p><p>Jennifer was later excluded from a few events, with fans noticing she wasn't in any of the photos the cast was posting. Although there is much to be discovered on the upcoming season, it's clear that both Jennifer and Teresa are not having it with Margaret, and we don't blame them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Teresa And Jackie's Dramatic Relationship On 'RHONJ'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpmcYrWwwdKerqKulah6r7HWZqGeqqOaxm7AxKucrJldnLa2sMicnGaZnpl6rq3RoJirnaRit7C%2FxKmfrGWWp7amusOsZJ6mlaK2pr%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elise-kristine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-605806-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elise Kristine Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
