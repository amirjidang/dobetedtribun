The label is known for its commitment to promoting <a href=#>new and innovative artists</a>, and for its dedication to helping them grow their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-9-2.jpg><p>Chris Daughtry and the rest of his band members released their first studio album under the Dogtree record label, ‘Dearly Beloved’ which was released in 2021 and was the debut album to be released under that imprint, with no major record labels involved. The two singles from that album, ‘World On Fire’ and ‘Heavy Is The Crown’ proved its success on the music charts with their powerful, melodic, and dynamic production. Chris Daughtry described their album, ‘Dearly Beloved’ as 100 percent therapy. He described the freedom he feels with this album, and what will separate this one from the rest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daughtry is invigorated and seeking new and exciting sounds. He is also incorporating his passion for acting, action, and comic books into his work. Essentially, he is putting just as much, if not more, of himself into his work as he has in the past. Dogtree Labels have released eight records since 2021, all under the artistry of the rock band Daughtry.</p><h2 id=is-the-band-daughtry-still-together>Is The Band Daughtry Still Together?</h2><p>The <a href=#>rock band</a> Daughtry is still active and together.
