After shunning television for the first two and a half decades of his career, in 2007 Pierre White became the Head Chef on Hell's Kitchen. He would go on to present an additional three cooking programs, including Hell's Kitchen Australia, which he joined as retaliation after Matt Preston, host of rival program Masterchef Australia, made disparaging remarks about Pierre White's son on air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=levi-roots---45-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Levi Roots - $45 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>Levi Roots first gained recognition as a chef appearing on the reality business show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon's Den</a> in 2007, seeking 50,000 Great British Pounds in investment to launch his Reggae Reggae jerk sauce business.
