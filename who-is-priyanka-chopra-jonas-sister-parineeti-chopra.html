While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it may seem like Parineeti is living in her sister's shadow</a>, she is a celebrity in her own right. She rose to prominence in 2011 after featuring in&nbsp;Ladies vs Ricky Bahl.&nbsp;She has garnered herself enough success to be called a household name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 32-year-old didn't always want to be an actor, she wanted to be an investment banker.

I would say the one-and-half years were truly the worst time of my life. Two of my films, Daawat-e-Ishq and Kill Dil didn’t work. That was my first setback.</p><p>"Suddenly I didn’t have money. I had bought a house and done big investments. Then I went through a big heartbreak in my life. Literally, all departments in my life were down and I had nothing positive to look forward to."</p><p>Taking about one's mental health can be a terrifying thing to do, it can even be more terrifying for celebrities whose lives are under constant scrutiny. However, Parineeti chose to open up about battling depression.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just used to be in my room, watching TV, sleeping, getting up, staring all day. I was a zombie. I was a typical filmy depressed girl. I would curl up on my sofa and sleep, falling ill all the time. I didn’t meet the media for almost six months."</p><p>Parineeti is seemingly doing great these days. She has most recently starred in the Hindi remake of&nbsp;The Girl on The Train, which will be available on Netflix from the 26th of February 2021. It could be a game-changer for the star as it could very well be the movie that'll land her in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chantel Jeffries Got Her New Favorite Anxiety Tip From TikTok</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvNGisJqmm5Z6pLTOqamaZZqku6K%2FjKygrKyVp3qxrdGipZ6dpJ56pLTOqamaZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-richard-irvins-wife-crystal-irvin-how-rich-is-the-mayor-of-aurora-318137-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Richard Irvins Wife, Crystal Irvin?
