From being linked to other Hollywood celebrities to starring in Oscar-winning films, <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong>, at the age of 58 years old, still finds his way to be on top of the headlines at this time. After his messy and public divorce with Angelina Jolie, many fans thought the Fight Club actor would take a rest from the dating sceneâ€”but they were wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Who is icole Poturalski</a>? Has Brad Pitt and Nicole been dating for quite some time now? Has Brad Pitt secretly had another with his new significant other? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=how-did-brad-pitt-meet-nicole-poturalski>How Did Brad Pitt Meet Nicole Poturalski?</h2><p>As a 5'10 model and cover girl for Elle Germany, Nicole is considered a top international model. Like the typical Hollywood romance story, Brad Pitt and Nicole Poturalski met through mutual friends three years after Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie divorced.</p><p>Since Brad Pitt became more secretive about his relationships after Angelina, it took the media quite some time before they discovered that Brad was already dating the German model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight even calls their relationship 'very private,'</a> following their insider's statement, "Brad [Pitt] and Nicole [Poturalski] were introduced through friends, and when they first started seeing each other, they told no one about it. Even some of their inner circle of friends are only finding out now. Brad has been very private about dating; now more than ever, he doesn't want to rock the boat with Angelina. He has been working hard to make his co-parenting [with Angelina] run smoothly."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Have Brad Pitt's Past Relationships Boosted His Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>The first time they were publicly seen together was during Brad Pitt's Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood movie in Berlin, where Nicole lives. Although they did not release any statement confirming their relationship in 2019, their more frequent sightings together became enough proof for the media to consider them dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-nicole-poturalski-in-an-open-marriage>Is Nicole Poturalski In An Open Marriage?</h2><p>Fans had mixed feelings when they discovered that Nicole Poturalski had been in an open marriage with her almost ten-year husband and restaurateur, Roland Mary. With their age twice Nicole's age, it was not surprising that Nicole got attracted to Brad Pitt, who is also twice her age.</p><p>Since<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nicole and Roland are in an open marriage</a>, an insider tells Daily mail that Roland is a very 'philosophical guy' and does not waste any of his energy on jealousy or negativity. Considering that the couple has been together for a long time, they already have a nine-year-old son named Emil.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Mysterious Truth About Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard's Rumored Open Marriage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans assume that Brad Pitt was aware of Nicole and Roland's situation and willingly still dated the model despite her open marriage. Neither Nicole nor Brad addressed the questions regarding Roland's thoughts on their relationship. Still, with how Roland Mary lets Nicole explore romantic relationships freely, there seems to be no conflict between him and Brad Pitt.</p><h2 id=why-did-brad-pitt-and-nicole-poturalski-break-up>Why Did Brad Pitt And Nicole Poturalski Break Up?</h2><p><a href=#>Brad Pitt has dated several women before Nicole Poturalski</a>, but their relationship became a spectacle because of how little they let the public know about them. Despite dating for almost eight months, the American actor and German model called it quits mid to late 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The News, Brad and Nicole's separation could hardly be called a breakup because they were more of a flight than a serious relationship. The source adds, "They [Brad Pitt and Nicole Poturalski] saw each other a few times, and that's it. You can't call it a split because they [Nicole and Brad] were never together in the first place. It [their relationship] was a casual fling, and that's it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt Still Close? Here's What We Know About Their Current Relationship</a></span></p><p>Fans seemed to agree with this, considering that Brad had previously stated that he wanted to focus on his relationship with his Jolie-Pitt children while Nicole was still in a long-time relationship with her husband despite being in an open marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-nicole-poturalski-and-brad-pitt-have-a-child>Did Nicole Poturalski And Brad Pitt Have A Child?</h2><p>Since their short-lived fling only lasted less than a year, and sources believe it wasn't a serious relationship, it is unlikely that Nicole Poturalski and Brad Pitt had a child. Especially noting that Nicole is still active in the international modeling scene, getting pregnant is assumably not part of her current plans so far.</p><p>However, there have been speculations that Brad could have considered adopting Nicole's son, Emil, as his stepson if they became a serious couple. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad and Emil were seen out having brunch in Berlin </a>when he was still dating Nicole, but Brad did not say anything about Emil to protect his privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like how Brad Pitt tries his best to keep his children's life out of the spotlight despite the fame that comes with him and Angelina Jolie, so does Nicole with her son Emil. However, with how complicated Brad Pitt's relationship is with his six children, fans think it isn't a good decision for him, even then, to adopt a new child.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Inside Brad Pitt's Extremely Complicated Relationship With His Kids</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmmqGhnJm%2FprqMsKCtoF2axW6zyKujn6qZmrulec2imqiklWK9sMDUq5ilq5uefA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adidas-boycott-kanye-west-stolen-designs-1234691922.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diddy And Swizz Beatz Defend Kanye West In Adidas Debacle">&larr;
