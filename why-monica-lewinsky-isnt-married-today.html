When President Bill Clinton was in office, a lot of the attacks against him revolved around his marriage to Hillary Clinton right from the start.</p><p>Unfortunately for Monica Lewinsky, she got wrapped up in that whirlwind and thrust into the public eye. Thankfully <a href=#>that scandal faded away years ago</a>, but now some onlookers are wondering something else about Lewinsky, why isn’t she married?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-public-rsquo-s-changing-perspective-of-monica-lewinsky>The Public’s Changing Perspective Of Monica Lewinsky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar51351635-2.jpg><p>In January of 1998, the world learned that the President of the United States at the time, Bill Clinton, had been carrying on an affair with a young woman named Monica Lewinsky. Employed as a White House intern at the time of her involvement with Clinton, when the world learned Lewinsky’s name she suddenly was thrust under an indescribably harsh spotlight.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_how-did-monica-lewinsky-make-her-money-and-what-is-she-worth-now-_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Did Monica Lewinsky Make Her Money (And What Is She Worth Now)?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Monica Lewinsky had an unconventional path to growing her wealth, but she's worth a decent amount of money today.</span><p>At the height of the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal, it seemed like everyone in the media had something extremely nasty to say about her. Never mind the fact that Bill was the one who was cheating on his wife and the power differential between them was massive, lots of people decided Lewsinky was the one to be blamed for the affair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many years after things finally calmed down, Monica Lewinsky wrote about what she went through and revealed she felt like “the most humiliated woman in the world”. Looking back on the coverage, it is easy to see why she felt that way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52440240.jpg><p>On the bright side, even though some observers still harshly judge her, a lot of people agree with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewinsky’s belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize to her</a>.</p><h2 id=why-monica-lewinsky-hasn-rsquo-t-gotten-married-yet>Why Monica Lewinsky Hasn’t Gotten Married Yet</h2><p>In decades past, women were expected to get married at a young age and if they didn’t, everyone assumed there was something seriously wrong with them. Thankfully, society has advanced a lot since then. However, if anyone thought that women no longer were pressured to walk down the aisle, they haven’t been paying attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of regular people and stars who’ve gotten married and divorced over and over again. With that in mind, you’d think that everyone would understand that trying to push people to get married no matter what is a mistake.</p><p>Despite that, lots of women above a certain age find themselves getting asked one question during every family reunion, when are you going to get married?</p><h2 id=monica-lewinski-chooses-to-keep-her-personal-life-private>Monica Lewinski Chooses To Keep Her Personal Life Private</h2><p>Even though society has progressed enough that people now know that Monica Lewinsky’s past treatment was horrendous, things are still pretty messed up. For proof of that, all you have to do is look at the fact that when Monica Lewinsky spoke to People in 2021, she was asked about the state of her love life today.</p><p>Even though it seems backward to ask a woman about her dating life after she was raked over the coals for years over a relationship, Monica Lewinsky handled the inquiry well. However, that doesn’t mean that Lewinsky was willing to gossip about her love life with People’s interviewer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I kinda feel if anybody has earned a right to have their romantic life private, it's me. Those relationships are very precious to me, even the one or two who turned out to be putzes. But I've learned a lot."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/monica-lewinsky.jpg><p>After stating that she wasn’t willing to talk about her relationships pubically, Monica Lewinsky went on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">address the fact that she has never been married</a>. "I do date. I'm not married yet. I don't know if that will happen or not, and I'm more okay with that than I used to be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Monica Lewinsky didn’t specifically state why she hasn’t gotten married in either of those quotes. However, it could easily be argued that both of those statements actually explain why Lewinsky hasn’t walked down the aisle.</p><p>As the first quote reveals, Monica Lewinsky is perfectly willing to admit that in her opinion, some of the people she has been involved with turned out to be “putzes”. It also is worth noting that even though she previously found it hard to accept the idea that she may never get married, she is beginning to come to terms with that.</p><p>When you look at those two concepts together, it certainly seems like Lewinsky is saying she hasn’t found the right partner yet and she has figured out that getting married to anyone is a bad idea. For someone who was pubically shamed for years, it is great to see that she seems to be doing a good job of not bowing to public pressure about her personal life.</p><p>Source: usatoday.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoryvtcKaZKWdp567tLfYZqCspqRiuqK%2B0aKcnWWkpLGixY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./musicians-re-recorded-music-why-reasons-revealed-taylor-swift-prince.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Reason These Musicians Re-Recorded Their Music, Revealed">&larr;
