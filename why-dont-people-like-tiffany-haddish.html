The multi-faceted actress and comedian has come a long way in her career, <a href=#>from living in her car to earning a net worth in excess of $6 million</a>. But although Haddish has plenty of fans, she also has her fair share of critics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some people may have disliked Tiffany from her debut, others became suspicious of her after a string of things they found unsettling. From various court cases to an arrest record, not everyone is a fan of Tiffany Haddish.</p><h2 id=tiffany-39-s-past-isn-39-t-exactly-squeaky-clean>Tiffany's Past Isn't Exactly Squeaky Clean</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Sad-Truth-About-Tiffany-Haddishs-Notable-Weight-Loss-And-How-Common-Reacted-To-How-She-Got-In-Shape.jpg><p>Unfortunately for Tiffany, her time in the spotlight hasn't been entirely smooth sailing. Plenty of people found her comedy funny, even when it extended to her hitting on various celebrities (<a href=#>many of whom turned her down</a>).</p><p>Haddish has also had plenty of noteworthy gigs in Hollywood, from stand-up comedy shows to voice acting in big-name movies like The Lego Movie films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after <a href=#>her arrest for a DUI</a> and <a href=#>abuse allegations made against her</a>, people looked a little closer at Tiffany and didn't seem to like what they saw. It only got worse as people chatted about Haddish's apparent wrongdoings over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sad Truth About Tiffany Haddish's Weight Loss And How Common Reacted To How She Got In Shape</a></span></p><p>Many called the star out over social media for various missteps like being "rude, immature, inappropriate, and harassing" people, which didn't end well.</p><p>Ultimately, Tiffany took to Twitter to say that she was leaving the platform after "people [were] feeling things and got lots to say." She wrote, "I wish you all some joy" and seemingly signed off. However, her account is still active as of April 2023, though it is now private and tweets are only visible to approved followers.</p><p>That hasn't stopped people from sharing their opinions on Haddish, or turning her name into a trending hashtag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-don-39-t-people-like-tiffany-haddish>Why Don't People Like Tiffany Haddish?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiffany-haddish-pointing-her-finger-in-the-air.jpg><p>There seem to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many reasons why people dislike Tiffany Haddish</a>, ranging from her being "unfunny" to being an "alleged child abuser, a nationalist for a military dictatorship," and for allegedly spreading misinformation.</p><p>One commenter wrote that Tiffany "tried to publicly discredit a victim of domestic violence" and then became upset when people began "coming for her publicly." Others called her a "liability," pointing out that after she seemingly spilled the beans on a Beyoncé and Jay-Z event she was invited to, she hadn't been asked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some also suggest that Tiffany actually bit Beyoncé during said party, which sounds awkward enough on its own.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tiffany Haddish Reveals Crush On Nicolas Cage With A Steamy Confession</a></span></p><p>It's not only the public that seems to have it out for Tiffany, though (Bey doesn't seem to have dragged Tiffany publicly, though she's said to have written lyrics about Haddish referring to making people sign nondisclosure agreements prior to parties).</p><p>Other celebrities have commented on why they don't love Haddish, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marlon Wayans once telling her (on TV no less) that she was unprofessional and immature</a>, which is why he didn't ask her to appear in any of his projects.</p><p>Haddish has also been accused of harassing a guest star on Issa Rae's show, and then there was a troublesome project in which Tiffany portrayed Rihanna in a skit that poked fun at the latter's assault at the hands of Chris Brown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-tiffany-haddish-in-2023>Where Is Tiffany Haddish In 2023?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design-41.jpg><p>People might expect that given all her negative headlines, Tiffany would have been canceled a long time ago. But to date, it doesn't seem that she's lost out on any projects because of reported bad behavior. In fact, she seems just as busy as ever.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiffany's IMDb listing</a> confirms multiple projects in 2023, including a TV series and a film that came out early in the year, plus multiple projects in pre- or post-production. A lot of people may be unhappy with Tiffany, but she's not losing opportunities over it—yet, at least.</p><p>And that lawsuit in which Haddish was accused of abusing two minors who worked on a comedy project with her? It was dismissed, and the alleged victim stated that she had realized Tiffany would never "harm" her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">so was withdrawing the suit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Argue Whether Tiffany Haddish Can Replace Ellen DeGeneres Amid Racial Tensions</a></span></p><p>That doesn't forgive all of Tiffany's other alleged indiscretions, but given that the two plaintiffs withdrew their complaints, that case is closed. During the case, Tiffany spoke out, but didn't reveal much, noting that she "deeply regret[ted] having agreed to act in" the project that resulted in the lawsuit. Still, plenty of critics are outspoken about not supporting Tiffany's work and holding her to a higher standard.</p><p>One Redditor wrote, "She wasted so much goodwill and support," yet squandered it, and countless others agreed, calling Tiffany all manner of bad names while suggesting no one would miss her on Twitter or elsewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear whether those heavy criticisms of the comedian will impact her ability to work in Hollywood, but to date, it doesn't seem to have made a difference in her work or personal life. Except, of course, the fact that her Twitter account went private.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbyvwIypnKionJp6rbXKnmStoZabrq%2FFjKGYnZyZqLVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./did-madelyn-cline-get-pkastic-surgery-before-and-after.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Madelyn Clines Face Really Change After She Became Famous?">&larr;
