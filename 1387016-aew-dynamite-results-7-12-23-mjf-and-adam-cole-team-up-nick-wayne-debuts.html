He locks in the Lion-tamer, and Komander taps out.</p><p>Don Callis came to the ring and says the world is buzzing about the two of them potentially working together. Callis looks back on their history together and plays a clip of them when they were younger. Jericho notes that he remembers that time, and he makes fun of Callis for losing his hair. He remembers their mentor, Bad News Allen, telling them to stay together. Callis says Bad News must be looking down on them from heaven with a smile on his face, as he would be happy to see them working together. Callis leaves, and Jericho clearly has a lot to think about.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Backstage, Jack Perry refuses to get out of his car, as he says he’s in an unsafe work environment. HOOK shows up and attacks Perry, but he escapes.</p><p>Don Callis says he’ll announce the final member of Blackpool Combat Club’s team for the Blood & Guts match. He says he’ll be going out to the ring by himself, as he’s not scared of Kenny Omega.</p><p>MJF and Adam Cole did some more bonding, as they went to the bar. Four women walk by, and MJF pitches that means two for each of them. Cole turns him down, and MJF goes off with all four of them. Cole asks MJF to play AEW Fight Forever with him, and they do. MJF says it’s fun to play games with someone. Cole asks him if he’s never played with anyone before, and MJF notes that you have to have friends for them. MJF and Cole tell each other they were going to betray each other, but then they say they’re cool. Cole and MJF win the tag team titles in the video game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Guevara and Cassidy start the bout and feel each other out.

He discusses training with his father, Buddy Wayne. He recalls finding out his dad passed away. Nick says he kept training, at least partially, to honor his father. He says he’s ready for the pressure, as he’s been preparing for his whole life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Backstage, Adam Cole is approached by Roderick Strong, who asks if Cole is starting to like MJF. Cole says MJF isn’t half bad. He gets a text from MJF, who apparently got a “flu” ahead of their tournament match.</p><p>:</p><p>MJF enters, so he will compete as advertised. MJF goes for a bodyslam on Big Bill, but he can’t lift him. He tags Cole and starts to walk out, but Cole chases him down and brings him back. Cage flexes, and Cole does some push-ups. MJF tags back in, determined to slam Big Bill. He still can’t pick him up. MJF does some push-ups, and Bill stomps him. Bill takes the fight to MJF.

Cole and MJF double-team Bill, but Cage trucks over them. Cage slams both men.</p><p>Cole and MJF rally, as MJF hits the Heatseeker. Cole gets the win with The Boom.</p><p>After the bell, MJF goads Cole on and gets him to do the “Adam Cole, bay-bay” taunt. MJF highlights their new t-shirt. The champion says they’re going to hit the double clothesline. MJF tugs Cole’s shirt, and he gets a little upset. Cole says he never expected his team with MJF to work. Cole expresses his confidence that they will win the tournament and, from there, the titles. He says they will win the titles if they stay on the same page.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Backstage, Jake Hager asks Chris Jericho if he was actually considering Don Callis’ offer, and he noted that he wasn’t sure, as they had history.
