He's a staple in the movie industry, for both good and bad reasons. When it comes to making films, Quentin's antics can be questionable. He's known for pushing his actors to their limits to ensure that they give him the best takes possible. He is also known for putting his cast members in dangerous scenarios for the sake of good television. However, this isn't to say that Quentin is a heartless man, quite the opposite, really.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quentin Tarantino is a beloved actor, writer, director, and friend to loads of A-listers. He has pumped out hit after hit and tons of actors desperately want to work with him. It's no secret that landing a gig with Quentin can change one's life overnight. Still, some actors would rather keep their distance from the famed director, for more reasons than one. Keep reading to find out which actors turned Tarantino down, and which ones are still waiting for his call.</p><h2 id=rejected-max-julien-refused-to-star-in-pulp-fiction-because-he-disliked-a-scene-in-the-movie><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Rejected: Max Julien Refused To Star In Pulp Fiction Because He Disliked A Scene In The Movie</span></h2><p>When it came to casting the role of Pulp&nbsp;<i>Fiction's</i>&nbsp;Marsellus Wallace, Quentin Tarantino only had one person in mind: Max Julien. Sadly, Max refused to take part in the movie after reading the script. There was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a disturbing&nbsp;scene in the film</a> that Max wasn't all that crazy about. So, he refused.</p><h2 id=rejected-quentin-wrote-the-role-of-bill-from-kill-bill-with-warren-beatty-in-mind-but-the-actor-turned-it-down><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Rejected: Quentin Wrote The Role Of Bill From Kill Bill With Warren Beatty In Mind... But The Actor Turned It Down</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Quentin Tarantino began writing the script for Kill Bill, he wrote the part of Bill with Warren Beatty in mind. Quentin went on to offer the role to Warren, who refused it because he did not want to travel to China to film the movie. The character then had to be modified for the next actor in line.</p><h2 id=rejected-michael-madsen-turned-down-the-role-of-pulp-fiction-s-vincent-vega><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Rejected: Michael Madsen Turned Down The Role Of Pulp Fiction's Vincent Vega</span></h2><p>Michael Madsen is Quentin Tarantino's longtime friend and collaborator. Still, that wasn't enough for Quentin to lock Michael down as Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction. Michael would have been up for the challenge if he hadn't already committed to Wyatt Earp. Michael turned down the role and it ultimately went to John Travolta.</p><h2 id=desperate-kevin-costner-would-love-to-work-with-the-famous-director><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Desperate: Kevin Costner Would Love To Work With The Famous Director</span></h2><p>Kevin Costner was looking forward to starring as Bill in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. He was offered the role after Warren Beatty. But just like Warren, Kevin had to turn down the role, choosing to focus on Open Range instead. Looks like Kevin lost his chance to star in a Tarantino movie. For now, at least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=desperate-christina-applegate-really-wanted-to-star-as-melanie-ralston-in-jackie-brown><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Desperate: Christina Applegate Really Wanted To Star As Melanie Ralston In Jackie Brown</span></h2><p>Christina Applegate was Quentin Tarantino's first choice to play Melanie Ralston in Jackie Brown. The actor was excited about the part but unfortunately couldn't commit to the role because of scheduling conflicts. Christina has yet to be offered another role in one of Quentin's film. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><h2 id=rejected-sylvester-stallone-told-quentin-he-couldn-t-play-jackie-brown-s-louis-gara><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rejected: Sylvester Stallone Told Quentin He Couldn't Play Jackie Brown's Louis Gara</span></h2><p>Sylvester Stallone is a legendary actor who also has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation for being quite shady.</a> Believe it or not, but Sylvester was Quentin's first pick when it came to casting the role of Jackie Brown's Louis Gara. Still, that wasn't enough to get Sylvester on board with the project, which he&nbsp;refused for unknown reasons.</p><h2 id=desperate-matt-dillon-was-supposed-to-play-butch-coolidge-in-pulp-fiction><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Desperate: Matt Dillon Was Supposed To Play Butch Coolidge In Pulp Fiction</span></h2><p>Matt Dillon was thrilled when Quentin Tarantino offered him the role of Butch in Pulp Fiction. He was all set to star in the movie when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin changed his mind and gave the role to Bruce Willis</a>. Quentin did this because Matt expressed concern over the role. Big mistake, Matt, big mistake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rejected-sylvester-stallone-refused-to-play-mike-mckay-in-death-proof><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rejected: Sylvester Stallone Refused To Play Mike McKay In Death Proof</span></h2><p>Sylvester Stallone is a simple man. He loves boxing, he loves acting,&nbsp;and most of all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he loves his car collection</a>. Sylvester was stunned when Quentin offered him the role of Mike McKay in Death Proof, which he turned down because it was much too gory (and he had two daughters to think about).</p><h2 id=rejected-adam-sandler-turned-down-the-role-of-sgt-donny-donowitz-in-inglorious-basterds><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rejected: Adam Sandler Turned Down The Role Of Sgt. Donny Donowitz In Inglorious Basterds</span></h2><p>When it comes to Adam Sandler, it's safe to say that he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a slew of actors and directors that he prefers to work with</a>, and Quentin Tarantino isn't one of them. Still, he isn't opposed to the idea. Quentin wanted Adam to star as Donny Donowitz in Inglorious Basterds. But Adam chose to star in Funny People instead.</p><h2 id=desperate-macaulay-culkin-really-wanted-to-star-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-but-his-audition-wasn-t-up-to-par><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Desperate: Macaulay Culkin Really Wanted To Star In Once Upon A Time In Hollywood... But His Audition Wasn't Up To Par</span></h2><p>When news of Quentin Tarantino's film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood made headlines, Macaulay Culkin decided to audition for a role. He wanted to work with Quentin to help re-establish himself as an actor. Sadly, Macaulay revealed that his audition was a disaster. The star told Esquire that he wouldn't have hired himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macaulay Culkin Joins American Horror Story Season 10</a></span></p><h2 id=rejected-will-smith-refused-to-star-as-django-because-he-didn-t-enjoy-the-film-s-theme-of-vengeance><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rejected: Will Smith Refused To Star As Django Because He Didn't Enjoy The Film's Theme Of Vengeance</span></h2><p>Quentin Tarantino approached him for the role of Django in Django Unchained. Will was looking forward to reading the script but rejected the role once he realized that the film was about revenge and not love. Although both themes existed, Will didn't enjoy the overall message. The role eventually went to Jamie Foxx.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Roles Will Smith Turned Down (And 5 He Was Rejected For)</a></span></p><h2 id=rejected-jonah-hill-turned-down-the-role-of-scotty-harmony-in-django-unchained-due-to-scheduling-conflicts><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rejected: Jonah Hill Turned Down The Role Of&nbsp;Scotty Harmony&nbsp;In Django Unchained Due To&nbsp;Scheduling Conflicts</span></h2><p>Django Unchained wasn't the easiest movie to make.&nbsp;Filming went over schedule plenty of times, causing actors to drop out of the production. One of these actors was Jonah Hill. Quentin had originally created the character Scotty Harmony, who was meant to be played by Jonah. But when Jonah dropped out, Quentin dropped the character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rejected-viggo-mortensen-passed-on-the-role-of-jody-domergue-in-the-hateful-eight><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rejected: Viggo Mortensen&nbsp;Passed On The&nbsp;Role Of Jody Domergue In The Hateful Eight</span></h2><p>Viggo Mortensen was all set to play Jody Domergue in The&nbsp;Hateful Eight. The actor was tasked with taking French lessons for the role, but couldn't commit to them due to working on Jauja and Far From Men. As a result, Viggo had to reject the project. Fans are still waiting for a Viggo-Quentin collaboration.</p><h2 id=desperate-channing-tatum-all-but-harassed-quentin-for-a-role-in-the-hateful-eight><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Desperate: Channing Tatum All But Harassed Quentin For A Role In The Hateful Eight</span></h2><p>No one wanted to work with Quentin Tarantino more than Channing Tatum. He did everything in his power to get on Quentin's radar. Still, Quentin didn't think Channing was the guy for the job. Finally, after receiving a month's worth of emails, Quentin agreed to give Channing the role of Jody Domergue.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Pics Of Jonah Hill And Channing Tatum That Show Their True Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=rejected-jennifer-lawrence-turned-down-the-role-of-daisy-domergue-in-the-hateful-eight-because-she-was-way-too-busy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rejected: Jennifer Lawrence Turned Down The Role Of Daisy Domergue In The Hateful Eight Because She Was Way Too Busy</span></h2><p>Quentin Tarantino has been vocal about his love for Jennifer Lawrence.
