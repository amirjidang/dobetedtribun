Despite the Mike White series having a large ensemble cast with a few notable standouts, such as <a href=#>rising star Simona Tabasco</a>, there's no doubt that each episode provides an opportunity for a new actor to steal the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Leo Woodall's Jack first took off his shirt and jumped into the hotel pool, it's unlikely the audience thought he would be as engaging as <a href=#>the romantically-challenged Albie, played by Adam DiMarco</a>. But, low and behold, he too is starting to steal the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During an interview with Vulture</a>, Woodall explained what it was really like to join the cast of the successful HBO series and shed light on his relationship with his castmates...</p><h2 id=what-leo-woodall-really-thinks-about-playing-jack-in-the-white-lotus>What Leo Woodall Really Thinks About Playing Jack In The White Lotus</h2><p>While Leo Woodall's <a href=#>filmography isn't as long as his castmates,</a> there's no doubt you've seen him in a couple of things, including Peacock's Vampire Academy and Tom Holland's Cherry. But joining the cast of The White Lotus is by far the biggest boost the Essex-born star has had so far in his burgeoning career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his interview with Vulture, Woodall explained just how crazy it was for him to be chosen by creator Mike White and join the successful series.</p><p>"It was a combination of 'Pinch me' and 'How am I going to do this?'" Leo Woodall admitted to Vulture. "I watched the first season not knowing there was an audition in my inbox for season two. I fell in love with the show, and only a couple weeks later did I clock that I had an audition for the next season. Going into it, I thought some stars had aligned and I had to, regardless of the pressure, have as much fun as I can."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exactly What White Lotus Star Jennifer Coolidge Was Doing In The 80s Before Becoming An Actor</a></span></p><p>When Leo Woodall first joined the cast, he had no idea about his shocking twist with his "uncle" Quentin, played by Tom Hollander. But soon, after he was told what was going to happen with their dynamic.</p><p>"I’d been told I might have a rumble and tumble with a couple of characters, but I didn’t know who. When I was told that Tom Hollander was playing my uncle, I was already elated," he said to Vulture. "Then the news dropped about that moment and I just had about ten seconds of silence, digesting it."</p><p>Woodall admitted that he had to mentally prepare for a number of scenes in the series, not just the turn of events at the end of episode 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The whole job was about mentally preparing to go into the best show in the world, so everything that came with it took some mental preparation," He said. "My first day of filming was actually that sexy scene with [Portia actor] Haley [Lu Richardson]. That was the introduction to this job. Quite rock and roll!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>White Lotus Star Haley Lu Richardson Has A Complicated Relationship With Her Looks</a></span></p><p>One of the things that calmed Woodall's nerves was the fact that creator Mike White encouraged him to bring aspects of his own personality into the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There’s something crazy about how incredible his script is but how casual and easy he is. He encouraged us to muck around. In <a href=#>episod</a>e<a href=#> four</a> when we’re at the bar, I made up a line where I say, 'Dos Jägermeister, dos Red Bull,' because I thought it would be funny for him to speak Spanish to an Italian bartender. I thought Mike would cut it, but I think he put it in!"</p><h2 id=is-leo-woodall-friends-with-his-white-lotus-co-stars>Is Leo Woodall Friends With His White Lotus Co-stars?</h2><p>If you've seen or read any interview with Leo Woodall, it's pretty easy to deduce that the man makes friends really fast. Much like his White Lotus character, the man exudes an energy that many gravitate to. He's fun. According to his interview with Vulture, it seems Woodall got on with his co-stars extremely well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>White Lotus Creator Mike White Got Extremely Honest About Season One's Controversial Ending</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I arrived maybe a week or two after a few of the others. But I did have to go back and forth from London for the first month or so. We were all becoming friends and I started to get FOMO so I decided not to leave," he explained to Vulture.</p><p>As for his relationship with the man who plays his uncle, Woodall called Tom Hollander (Quentin) "a gentleman and a true professional."</p><p>"There was a moment where he gave me a real boost because I was feeling very overwhelmed early on. On our second shoot day, he just sort of figuratively put an arm around me and was supportive. I’ve got a lot of respect for that," Leo Woodall said to Vulture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Woodall spent a lot of time hanging out with the other cast members in between filming in Italy.</p><p>"There was a really nice day where me, Meghann [Fahy], Adam [DiMarco], Beatrice [Granno], Simona [Tabasco], Haley [Lu Richardson], and Aubrey [Plaza] went to a beach and swam out to this big rock. There were a lot of nights out. There was a fun day where Meghann and I went to the beach and came back and Murray Abraham was sat down having a drink and we joined him for a couple hours and hung out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqddrLywsMClo2aZo2K3oq%2FKZqCnZaSdsm7Dx6KrnmWcpMG2v4ysnJqrn6N6c3nCmqqtZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./6-letter-words.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="List of 6 Letter Words Ending With 'itch'">&larr;
