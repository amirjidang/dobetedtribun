Actress Marie Avgeropoulos's first acting gig didn’t exactly make her star in Hollywood. Though, it got her foot through the door.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone knows Avgeropoulos for her role as Octavia Blake aka the Red Queen on the CW’s popular sci-fi series “The 100”, most of us forgot she snagged <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her first acting gig on “Supernatural.”</a> Clearly, the actress has an affinity for the sci-fi and paranormal, not to mention, the CW tv network. Unfortunately, the actress’s role on the show didn’t prove as heroic or tough-as-nails as on “The 100.” Instead, Marie Avgeropoulos had to play the role of a dead cheerleader. As if that weren’t enough, the actress died in a toilet. Looking back on the role, we’d expect the actress to have plenty to say about her death on “Supernatural.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To 'Supernatural' Actress Samantha Smith?</a></span></p><h2 id=marie-avgeropoulos-threatened-supernatural-directors-during-death-scene>Marie Avgeropoulos Threatened Supernatural Directors During Death Scene</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Making a debut acting role can be the best feeling the world. However, for some actors, their first time on tv proved unsatisfactory. In Marie Avgeropoulos’ case, her first television debut was all-around bad news.</p><p>The actress booked her first tv-acting gig back in 2009 on one of the longest-running CW shows in history, “Supernatural.” Avgeropoulos guest-starred in season 4 of the series, on the episode “After School Special.” The 34-year-old played the role of Taylor, a popular cheerleader who’s terrorized and banished by her friends at lunch after word gets out about her sexual endeavors. Her character sits at another table, with a female student who attempts to befriend her. However, Taylor rejects the girl and calls her a “fat, ugly, pig.” The next day, in the girl’s bathroom, Taylor attempts to apologize to the girl for being so cruel the other day. However, the girl has been possessed by Dirk’s vengeful spirit and ends up killing Taylor by shoving her head into a toilet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with TV Guide back in 2016</a>, the 34-year-old revealed how she truly felt about her death by “the swirly” on “Supernatural.” Avgeropoulos explained to TV Guide that the directors made her “stick her head in a toilet, with her mouth and eyes open, and start screaming . . . So I just basically threatened his life and said if anyone ever took a dump in that toilet, then it will not end well for you . . . They basically promised me that no one used that throne, though.” The “Supernatural” directors should consider themselves lucky.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 'Supernatural' Series Finale Featured A Callback That Almost Everyone Missed</a></span></p><h2 id=marie-avgeropoulos-career-path-wavered>Marie Avgeropoulos’ Career Path Wavered</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to realizing our passions in life, some people struggle with finding their true calling. Marie Avgeropoulos for instance, seemed like she was meant to work as an actress. Despite having played such a minor role on “Supernatural” as a dead cheerleader, it became clear that Marie Avgeropoulos was meant for the spotlight. However, the 34-year-old didn’t have a straight and narrow path that led to acting. In fact, she yearned to become a full-time journalist.</p><p>In speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Involve Magazine back in June 2020</a>, the actress admitted that she went to college to study Television Broadcast Journalism. As much as she enjoyed writing news stories, Avgeropoulos disliked “writing depressing stories from 9 to 5 every day.” The actress told Involve Magazine that she flat out quit and decided to go backpacking throughout Europe. It’s unknown what she did throughout her travels but it’s for certain that she honed in on her true craft. The 34-year-old eventually moved to L.A, booking a couple of commercials, and eventually snagged a part on the CW’s “The 100” series. “Supernatural” gave Avgeropoulos a leg-up in the acting world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What’s Next For Jensen Ackles After Supernatural?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-come-a-long-way-since-supernatural>She’s Come A Long Way Since Supernatural</h2><p>Clearly, working on “Supernatural” opened a lot of doors for the 34-year-old star. In fact, since her “death-by-swirly” days working on the show, Marie Avgeropoulos kept herself busy with several big-time roles. After her big break, the actress took on several other memorable roles in sci-fi shows like “Fringe”, “The Cult” and “The Inbetweeners”. Other notable merits by the actress include films like 2010’s “Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief”, 2016’s “Dead Rising: Endgame” and most recently, the 2020 sci-fi martial arts film “Jiu-Jitsu.” Clearly, Avgeropoulos has a knack for taking on roles in the science fiction realm. Although, the 34-year-old proves she’s a very versatile actress, having starred in a few comedies throughout her career such as the 2009 film “I Love You, Beth Cooper.” With several notable tv and film credits under her belt, the Greek beauty has proven herself a more established actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, she’s probably buried her past acting experience on “Supernatural” in the dirt by now. The “death-by-swirly” surely hadn’t been the actress’s best moment in her acting career. Even during her interview with TV Guide, she made it clear she wasn’t a fan of guest-starring on the show as the cheerleader who dies by the hands of toilet. Honestly, who could blame her? Luckily, since her time on the show, the actress has went on to take on more glorifying roles.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The True Origin Of 'Supernatural'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqZmnqiwsaeqaion6q5sL%2BMrKypnaKjrrXB0ZqjZpyVlsGpedOhnGZpYGV8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-taylor-swift-make-merchandise-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Does Taylor Swift Actually Make On All Her Merchandise?">&larr;
