His final film, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' was really just the icing on the cake of a lucrative and varied career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry's final on-screen appearances was on 'Riverdale,'</a> which commemorated his character and the actor himself. Perry, who was 52 when he passed away, clearly lived life while he was here, but he did leave a few special people behind.</p><p>Fortunately for those loved ones, Luke had a plan in place for his finances.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Luke Perry Get Along With His '90210' Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> elaborated, Luke Perry built up his net worth starting back in the '90s. His many TV shows and films rounded out a $10 million net worth by the time he joined the 'Riverdale' cast and signed on for Quentin Tarantino's most recent hit.</p><p>And although Perry had previously been married, he was, in the eyes of the law, single at the time of his passing. He was wed to Minnie Sharp in 1993, but they divorced in 2003 after welcoming two children together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Luke suffered a stroke in early 2019, however, his fianceé, Wendy Madison Bauer, was at his side along with his ex-wife and children. Perry's mom, step-father, and siblings were also at the hospital when the decision was made to remove Luke from life support.</p><p>Unfortunately for Madison Bauer, notes&nbsp;Radar Online, Perry's will likely only covered his two children. Sophie and Jack were the sole inheritors of all Perry's wealth, says&nbsp;Radar Online, highlighting a previous health scare that spurred the actor to take action.</p><p>After a cancer scare back in 2015, Luke said that he drafted up a will so that nothing would be left to chance, reported&nbsp;Radar Online. However, while many publications use the term "will" fairly loosely, it depends what type of documentation Luke actually got that determines how much his kids get and when.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, if Luke Perry had his wealth in trust, then his children would automatically have access to the funds, unless their dad placed limits on it, such as requiring them to attend college first or some other specification. In contrast, if all he had was a will, Luke's kids may need to head to probate court to get their inheritance.</p><p>Although, it seems like whatever funds Luke's daughter Sophie inherited, she's put it to good use.</p><p>His son, Jack, AKA Jungle Boy, a wrestler, likely doesn't need his dad's cash as he's found fame on his own with the AEW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And for Perry's fianceé, unless the legal documents added her to the will or trust, there was likely not a dime to be seen. As&nbsp;Radar Online pointed out, unless Luke outlined a particular amount to be left to her, Wendy wouldn't get anything from his estate. There's also the fact that Luke apparently had the documents written up in 2015 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before he'd met his future fianceé</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics That Make Us Miss Luke Perry</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnrupsdGiq56cXaHCrLGMqZyrqqlifnF5zKKjpaGfo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-audra-day-everything-on-andra-day-elder-sister.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Audra Day?
