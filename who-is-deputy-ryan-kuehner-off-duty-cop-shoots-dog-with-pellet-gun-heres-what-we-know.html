An Off-Duty Cop Shoots Dog With Pellet Gun<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ryan Kuehner, a former cop from St Charles County, Missouri, shot a three-year-old dog with a Pellet gun.</p><p>He killed a mastiff mix and rescue dog Apollo just because the dog walked into his yard. As a result, the deputy took a big step of killing a pet animal; thus, it died in a shooting on May 22.</p><p>After the video of him being confronted by his neighbor became viral, Ryan has been repeatedly regarded as a psychopath who holds a position of power while proving to our community that he is a violent person who is not mentally capable of holding said position.</p><p>After around a month or so, the ex-St. Charles County sheriff’s deputy faced a misdemeanor charge in the death of the innocent dog in July 2022.</p><p>With this, many have wished and demanded to have the cop removed from his position as a cop as he did not even feel zero hesitation in playing a lead part in the pet animal’s death. He made such an inhumane decision even though the dog did not do anything to harm anyone.</p><p>According to some online reports, Kuehner currently has police guards around his house instead of being held in jail awaiting trial.</p><p>Ryan Kuehner shot his neighbor’s dog, making people question if such kind of person deserves to be a law enforcer or if such kind of person can protect the people.</p><p>The petition for him to be removed from Saint Charles Missouri Sherrif’s department for using a pellet gun to kill his neighbor’s dog has been supported by more than 8,900 people.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ryan-kuehner-wife-who-is-he-married-to></span>Ryan Kuehner Wife: Who Is He Married To?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ryan Kuehner’s wife’s details remain to be explored on the web.</p><p>In the viral confrontation video, we saw him being followed by a lady in the back, who seemed to be his wife. He was confronted by Eric Bacon and his wife, Erica Hansen. The two were the owners of the deceased dog and were devastated as they lost their three-year-old dog, whom they had considered a part of their family.</p><p>Ryan appears to be a man probably in his 40s or 50s, so it is guessed that he is married with a family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-about-ryan-kuehners-resignation-on-reddit></span>More About Ryan Kuehner’s Resignation On Reddit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ryan Kuehner’s case of dog has been discussed on&nbsp;Reddit, and his resignation part as well.</p><p>Some Reddit users even wrote about wishing him to lose his job and get charged with felonies. It is also found that the St. Charles County Sheriff’s Department has had a deputy stationed outside his house throughout the day.</p><p>It is learned that Kuehner’s neighbor’s dog had wandered shortly into his yard. But, the next second, not only did he kill this dog, but when confronted by the neighbor about it, he responded to his neighbor like “you’ll be hearing from me” with “okay? And I’m proud”, etc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ydnKmtpK56s8XAp2SkrZWdu6a%2BjKidn2WUqsG6ecKop2armKS8tb%2BMnaagZaeewal5z56jpZ2kYrS2uoyhnKudo2LEqa3TZq6eZZujvLg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-natalie-viscuso-meet-henry-cavill-girlfriend-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Natalie Viscuso?
