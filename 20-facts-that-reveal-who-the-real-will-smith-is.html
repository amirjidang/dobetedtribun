He has never-ending ambition and he's multitalented, so there never seems to be a limit when it comes to the things Will achieves. He's already scooped up multiple Grammys and two Oscar nominations, and he was famously deemed the 'go-to' actor for a successful summer flick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His relationship with his children, Trey, Willow, and Jaden Smith, as been as entertaining to watch as his entertainment projects. The actor is married to Jada Pinkett-Smith, who he met on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but there's so much more to Will than we know. He can still command an impressive $20 million for each and every motion picture he signs on for.</p><p>If you haven't been keeping up with his adventurous life and all of his trials and tribulations, stay tuned for 20 facts that will give you a closer look at who the real Will Smith is...</p><h2 id=his-real-name><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>His Real Name</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many just assume that Will Smith is the actor’s legal name, but that’s not quite the case, as the Hollywood star, whose real name is Willard Carroll Smith Jr., made the change once he realized he was serious about a career in entertainment. Willard didn’t quite do it for Will, consequently leading to the minor change.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-doesn-t-believe-in-punishing-his-children><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>He Doesn’t Believe In Punishing His Children</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is perhaps every kid’s dream to hear - no punishment at all times. Yes, Will and Jada do not believe in any of that.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“We don’t do punishment,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will explained</a>. “The way that we deal with our kids is, they are responsible for their lives. Our concept is, as young as possible, give them as much control over their lives as possible and the concept of punishment, our experience has been — it has a little too much of a negative quality.”</span></p><h2 id=he-earned-his-first-grammy-for-his-song-summertime><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>He Earned His First Grammy For His Song ‘Summertime’</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 1991, after forming the duo act, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Will put out a record named Summertime, which many may remember, given that it went on to win a Grammy award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. This was Will’s first Grammy. It was a clear sign that Will's many talents were set to take him far in Hollywood.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-one-of-the-highest-paid-actors-in-hollywood><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>He’s One Of The Highest-Paid Actors In Hollywood</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Will is one of the highest-paid actors in the business, having reportedly earned $20 million for the first two Bad Boys flicks, while he’s also expected to make an astounding $35 million from Netflix’s Bright 2.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His average salary per movie stands at roughly $15 million, depending on the budget of the film. There’s no denying that his star power is still being recognized, almost three decades into his career.</span></p><h2 id=he-turned-down-the-matrix-for-wild-wild-west><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>He Turned Down The Matrix For Wild Wild West</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Will has never shied away from revealing the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was approached to star as Neo</a> in The Matrix trilogy, but it appeared that he just didn’t believe in the project enough to sign on the dotted line. Instead, he went on to star in the not-so-great comedy-action flick, Wild Wild West, which was nowhere near as successful as The Matrix.</span></p><h2 id=he-is-the-first-hip-hop-star-to-be-nominated-for-an-oscar><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Is The First Hip-Hop Star To Be Nominated For An Oscar</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While he has yet to actually win an Oscar, Will Smith is the first hip-hop star to be nominated for an Oscar for his performances in Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness. Both times, he was up for the Best Actor award, and even though he didn’t win, it’s still unbelievable to think that Will, who sold millions of records as a rapper before the ‘00s, had transitioned into becoming an A-list actor.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-met-his-wife-jada-pinkett-smith-because-of-fresh-prince><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He Met His Wife Jada Pinkett Smith Because Of Fresh Prince</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jada Pinkett-Smith had been auditioning to star as Will’s girlfriend on the TV show, but that role was later passed over to actress Nia Long. Needless to say, Jada’s encounter with Will on set would lead to a full-on romance between the two. They would go on to get married and welcome two kids into the world - Willow and Jaden Smith.</span></p><h2 id=he-has-three-siblings><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Has Three Siblings</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many don’t know that Will actually has three siblings - none of them happen to make many public appearances, but it’s believed that the movie star is very close with all of his family members. Will has a sister named Pamela, who is four years older than him, as well as siblings who are twins (Ellen and Harry). They are just three years younger.</span></p><h2 id=he-once-dated-supermodel-tyra-banks><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Once Dated Supermodel Tyra Banks</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Will met Jada, Tyra Banks, who’d had a cameo on ‘Fresh Prince’, had also been linked to him. The two were said to have been dating for a short period of time before calling it quits, but their romance didn’t end on bad terms.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since then, Tyra and Will have had plenty of friendly public encounters with each other. It was just a relationship that didn’t evolve into anything serious.</span></p><h2 id=he-helped-his-father-install-refrigerators-as-one-of-his-first-jobs><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Helped His Father Install Refrigerators As One Of His First Jobs</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of Will’s first jobs was far from glamorous. His father, Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., was a refrigerator engineer in Philadelphia. When Will became serious about making money in his teenage years, he joined his dad by helping him to install refrigerators in people’s houses. While that job made him enough money to get by with, Will knew he wanted more from life.</span></p><h2 id=he-was-nearly-bankrupt-before-nbc-approached-him-with-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Was Nearly Bankrupt Before NBC Approached Him With ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, he amassed a fortune once he made it in Hollywood, but at the beginning of his career, Will had really bad spending habits. These spending habits led him to owe the IRS a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.8 million in unpaid taxes</a>. The situation almost left him bankrupt in 1990, but NBC picked up The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. This changed&nbsp;Will’s life. He learned how to manage his money a little better, maybe because he had so much more of it.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-d-previously-been-married-to-sheree-zampino><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He’d Previously Been Married To Sheree Zampino</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to meeting Jada, Will had been in a three-year marriage with actress and businesswoman, Sheree Zampino. The two were married from 1992 to 1995, and it’s believed that it was Sheree who called it quits on the relationship. They share a son together (Trey Smith) and they have always remained on good terms with one another.</span></p><h2 id=his-friendship-with-dj-jazzy-jeff-went-beyond-the-fresh-prince><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Friendship With DJ Jazzy Jeff Went Beyond ‘The Fresh Prince’</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Again, Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff had a friendship built up before working together on the sitcom. They’d already traveled the world together and made millions in revenue from their songs as a duo. They've remained close pals ever since.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s not uncommon to see Will and Jazzy Jeff out and about together, with friends and family - they are practically brothers at this point.</span></p><h2 id=he-was-famously-nicknamed-mr-july><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Was Famously Nicknamed Mr. July</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The media would often refer to Will Smith as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. July</a> and it’s quite obvious as to why - the majority of his movies dropped during that month. July always proved to be a strong release time for the actor. Basically, anything that Will Smith put out in the summertime was bound to be a blockbuster hit.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-can-solve-the-rubik-s-cube-extremely-fast><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Can Solve The Rubik’s Cube Extremely Fast</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many fans aren’t aware that Will, despite his wild antics and funny personality, is extremely smart. He’s the only person in his family that knows how to solve Rubik’s Cube in less than a minute, which has been shown in some of his movies, such as The Pursuit of Happyness. Don’t let the funny side of this actor fool you, he’s smarter than people think.</span></p><h2 id=he-had-a-habit-of-remembering-everyone-s-lines><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Had A Habit Of Remembering Everyone’s Lines</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>During his years on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will would remember everyone’s lines in the script because he deemed himself to be a perfectionist. He knew he had to be on top of his game. He was a newcomer in a sitcom with plenty of established actors.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“It was my very first role, and I was very, very focused on being successful, so I learned the whole script and everyone else's lines,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he revealed</a>.</span></p><h2 id=he-was-a-millionaire-by-the-age-of-20><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Was A Millionaire By The Age Of 20</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While his sitcom didn’t come about until he was 21, Will had already been making money, from playing smaller roles and from his rising career as a rapper. So, it shouldn’t be hard to believe he was already a millionaire by the time he was 20.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>His hustle and ambition never went unnoticed, and though having found himself with tax problems, he snapped out of it soon enough to get his finances in order.</span></p><h2 id=acting-is-just-one-of-his-many-talents><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Acting Is Just One Of His Many Talents</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>As previously mentioned, Will is a man of many talents. He's proven himself to be a fantastic actor and he's also a platinum-selling recording artist, with hits such as Miami, Men in Black, and Gettin’ Jiggy With It. He has sold a whopping 10 million albums in the United States alone and went on to win four out of eight Grammys he was nominated for.</span></p><h2 id=he-used-to-hang-around-mariah-carey><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Used To Hang Around Mariah Carey</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In September 2018, Will shared a throwback photo of himself with R&B superstar, Mariah Carey, instantly sending his fans into a frenzy. Nobody seemed to have been aware that these two were close early on in their careers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mariah gushed over the pic on his Instagram account, which was taken in the early 90s, but we have yet to see the two reunite. Carey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reposted the photo</a> with the caption: “</span><span style=font-weight:400>When I only owned two dresses - one pink and one black.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-big-movie-role-was-in-six-degrees-of-separation><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His First Big Movie Role Was In Six Degrees Of Separation</span></h2><p>Will landed his big break playing the role of Paul in the 1993 flick,&nbsp;Six Degrees of Separation, starring alongside Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland. And while the movie didn't pull in the big bucks at the box office, it was enough for Will to be noticed in the film industry. The role helped him to become one of Hollywood's rising stars at that time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWWlrC1v4ytn5qsXaeyt7HApWSwoJ9iwamxjKucmqRdrLatuIyspKKsmGK2tHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./asap-rocky-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A$AP Rocky's Net Worth Doubled, Thanks To Rihanna And Fatherhood">&larr;
