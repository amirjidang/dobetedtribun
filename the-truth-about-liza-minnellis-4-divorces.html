Judy Garland became famous for portraying innocent and adorable Dorothy, and Garland's daughter, Liza Minnelli, has become a show business icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minnelli is also famous for getting divorced four times. There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many brief celebrity marriages</a>&nbsp;and while her fourth marriage only lasted 16 months, Minnelli's other three marriages lasted for a few years.</p><p>Let's take a look inside Liza Minnelli's four divorces.</p><h2 id=peter-allen-and-jack-haley-jr>Peter Allen And Jack Haley Jr.</h2><p>There are some stars who are super private about their relationships. Then there are others like Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about marriage counseling</a>.</p><p>While Liza Minnelli has lived in the public eye and is known for starring in the 1972 movie&nbsp;Cabaret, there aren't a ton of details about her four marriages. When the star is interviewed, she talks about her mother and what her childhood was like, although every once in a while she has commented on the end of her marriages.</p><p>Liza Minnelli's marriage to Peter Allen lasted from 1967 until 1974, and it seems like it was in trouble from the beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the night of their wedding, Minnelli <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found&nbsp;Allen being intimate with a man</a>. According to Vice,&nbsp;Allen then started seeing Mark Herron, who was married to her mother.</p><p>In 1974, Minnelli moved onto her second husband: Jack Haley Jr. This was an interesting match, as Minnelli's mother, Judy Garland, starred in&nbsp;The Wizard Of Oz&nbsp;with Haley's father, Jack Haley, who played the Tin Man, according to&nbsp;The Vintage News.</p><p>This marriage was over after five years. According to&nbsp;The Guardian, the relationship was more platonic than romantic and so they broke up: the publication explained, "Haley was husband number two and straight, but they were friends rather than lovers."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look Into Britney Spears’ ‘Chaotic’ Relationship With Kevin Federline</a></span></p><h2 id=the-third-marriage>The Third Marriage</h2><p>Minnelli's third marriage was to a sculptor named&nbsp;Mark Gero. According to&nbsp;The Guardian, she wanted to start a family with him. Tragically, she had three miscarriages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This marriage lasted from 1979 until 1992.</p><p>There isn't much information out there about the end of this marriage, and it sounds like a very painful time in the star's life. Minnelli has spoken a lot about growing up with Judy Garland as a mother and she told&nbsp;Vogue, "It wasn’t and isn’t easy to live a so-called normal life. I didn’t feel like I missed out on anything. You don’t ask a princess what it feels like to be a princess, because she doesn’t know anything but being a princess. I didn’t know anything but being Judy Garland’s daughter.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Connie Britton And Ex-Husband, John Britton?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-fourth-divorce>The Fourth Divorce</h2><p>Liza Minnelli's fourth divorce is from David Gest, a music promoter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gest said that Minnelli gave him herpes</a>&nbsp;and according to&nbsp;The Daily Mail, a source explained to the publication, "Liza is trying to be positive but we are all completely on the floor about the lies he (Gest) is telling. There doesn’t seem to be an end to it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There has been a lot of drama surrounding this divorce.&nbsp;The Daily Mail&nbsp;reported that Gest filed "accusations" with the Supreme Court of Manhattan and accused her of abuse. In 2003, Gest sued Minnelli for $10 million for "loss of work and illness caused by the marriage."</p><p>According to&nbsp;Vice, since Gest was a friend of Michael Jackson's, Minnelli went on&nbsp;The Joy Behar Show&nbsp;and said,&nbsp;"I grabbed [Michael]… And I said, 'Why did you let me marry this idiot?' He said, 'I thought you liked him! You look so happy. Your dress was so beautiful. I don't know. Let me go!' And I said, 'Michael, how could you.' He said, 'It's over, relax.' Then we looked at each other and we started to laugh. We really started to laugh."</p><p>According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, Gest and Minnelli's wedding was definitely lavish. 850 people attended and Michael Jackson was the best man. It cost $3.5 million and the cake was six feet tall. They decided on a no-fault divorce after a lot of turmoil as they continued to sue each other for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mercury News&nbsp;reported that while they were married 16 months, the divorce was over in 2007. Gest passed away in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Ana de Armas’ Ex-Husband Marc Clotet, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><p>Liza Minnelli has always had a pretty positive attitude despite what she has been through. According to&nbsp;NBC News, she once said,&nbsp;“People will say what they're going to say. Now it can upset you or you can [fight] against it, or they can say what they are going to say anyway and you can go get a hamburger. We go get a hamburger.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Lisa Rinna’s Daughters Following In Their Parents’ Footsteps?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rbXZmmSmoZ6jsq24yKxkbWWUnsOwvsKeqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./piers-morgan-chelsea-handler-what-happened-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Iconic Comedian Hates Piers Morgan And Fans Understand Why">&larr;
